Loss of functional synergy between 6p22lncRNAs results in an undifferentiated state that is maintained by a gene-regulatory network, including SOX9 located on 17q, a region frequently gained in NB. 6p22lncRNAs regulate SOX9 expression by controlling CHD7 stability via modulating the cellular localization of USP36, encoded by another 17q gene. This regulatory nexus between 6p22.3 and 17q regions may lead to potential NB treatment strategies. 	29533783	2018	Sense-Antisense lncRNA Pair Encoded by Locus 6p22.3 Determines Neuroblastoma Susceptibility via the USP36-CHD7-SOX9 Regulatory Axis.	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

Knock down of FOXP3 in MCF-10A normal mammary breast cells up-regulated the transcription of 7SL RNA. Chromatin Immuno-precipitation (ChIP) analysis showed that FOXP3 directly bound to the Forkhead/HNF-3 domain DNA binding sites (-789 to -795) relative to the transcription start site. Meanwhile, Luciferase analysis showed that FOXP3 repressed the full-length 7SL promoter activity, but this suppressive effect was reversed after mutation of the FOXP3 binding site. Further studies showed that FOXP3 promoted the expression of P53 at translational levels through repressing 7SL RNA.	26718402	2016	Tumor FOXP3 represses the expression of long noncoding RNA 7SL.	0	0	0	1	1	0	0

By using 91H-knockdown breast cancer cells, we demonstrated that 91H exerts oncogenic properties by promoting cell growth, migration and invasion as well as tumor growth in xenografted immunodeficient mouse model. Moreover, 91H-knockdown reduces the expression of H19 and IGF2 in breast cancer cells. By chromatin-immunoprecipitation and methylation studies, we found that 91H expression prevents histone and DNA methylation on the maternal allele at the H19/IGF2 locus.	27780718	2017	The long non-coding RNA 91H increases aggressive phenotype of breast cancer cells and up-regulates H19/IGF2 expression through epigenetic modifications.	0	0	0	0	0	0	1

We also found that inhibition of AATBC resulted in cell proliferation arrest through G1 cell cycle mediated by cyclin D1, CDK4, p18 and phosphorylated Rb. In addition, inhibition of AATBC induced cell apoptosis through the intrinsic apoptosis signaling pathway, as evidenced by the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. The investigation for the signaling pathway revealed that the apoptosis following AATBC knockdown was mediated by activation of phosphorylated JNK and suppression of NRF2. 	25473900	2014	Knockdown of a novel LincRNA AATBC suppresses proliferation and induces apoptosis in bladder cancer.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Knockdown of AB073614 expression significantly inhibited cell proliferation and invasion, resulted in cell arrest in G1 phase of cell cycle and a dramatic increase of apoptosis. Finally, western blot assays indicated that lncRNA AB073614 may exert its function by targeting ERK1/2 and AKT-mediated signaling pathway. In conclusion, our study suggests that lncRNA AB073614 acts as a functional oncogene in OC development.	26299803	2015	A long noncoding RNA AB073614 promotes tumorigenesis and predicts poor prognosis in ovarian cancer.	0	0	1	1	0	0	0

Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that increased AB073614 expression contributed to poor overall survival. Further, univariate Cox regression analysis indicated that lncRNA AB073614 overexpression was an unfavorable prognostic factor in gliomas, regardless of the tumor grade. Finally, after adjustment with age, sex, tumor grade and tumor location, multivariate Cox regression analysis suggested that both highly expressed lncRNA AB073614 and high tumor grade could be considered independent poor prognostic indicators for glioma patients	27104549	2016	Up-Regulation of Long Non-Coding RNA AB073614 Predicts a Poor Prognosis in Patients with Glioma	0	0	1	1	0	0	0

Decreased expression of lncAB in PTC was caused by CpG hypermethylation within its gene promoter. Functional studies showed that lncAB overexpression led to cell cycle arrest and tumor growth inhibition in vitro and  in vivo, whereas lncAB knockdown promoted cell proliferation. Mechanistic analyses revealed that lncAB bound KH-type splicing regulatory protein (KHSRP) and also decreased expression of KHSRP, thus increasing CDKN1a (p21) expression and decreasing CDK2 expression to repress cell proliferation. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that lncAB functions as a tumor suppressor during PTC tumorigenesis. 	29735546	2018	Long noncoding RNA AB074169 inhibits cell proliferation via modulation of KHSRP-mediated p21 expression in papillary thyroid carcinoma.	0	0	0	0	0	0	1

Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed to examine the expression of AB209630 in clinical HCC samples and the adjacent non-cancerous tissues. The reduced expression of AB209630 observed in HCC tissues and cultured HCC cells compared with normal hepatic tissues and cells prompted the construction of an AB209630-expressing plasmid with a CBP tag on the plasmid backbone. Cell proliferation and colony formation assays were conducted to detect the effects of AB209630 on HCC cell proliferation. In addition, Transwell assay and wound-healing assays were performed, the results of which further indicated that the overexpression of AB209630 inhibited the migration and invasion of HCC cells. These results revealed the inhibitory effects of AB209630 on HCC progression, and suggest the potential of AB209630 as an inhibitor of HCC for clinical use.	29042928	2017	Long non-coding RNA AB209630 suppresses cell proliferation and metastasis in human hepatocellular carcinoma	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

In addition, patients with decreased expression of AB209630 had a significantly poorer prognosis than those with high AB209630 expression. These data suggest that increased expression of AB209630 might either stimulate or inhibit biological activities involved in HSCC development, indicating a potential application of AB209630 in future treatment for this disease. This study suggest that AB209630 functions as a tumor suppressor in HSCC, and its decreased expression may help predict a poor prognostic outcome of HSCC.

Our data showed that AK096174 was highly expressed in the gastric cancer tissues and cell lines (SGC-7901, AGS, BGC-823, MGC-803), and patients with higher AK096174 expression had a poorer prognosis and shorter overall survival. AK096174 knockdown inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasiveness in SGC-7901 and BGC-823 cells, whereas AK096174 overexpression had the promoting effects. Furthermore, mechanistic investigation showed that AK096174 positively correlated with the expression of WD repeat-containing protein 66 (WDR66) gene at the translational level.

By our ChIP and Real-time PCR assays, we reveal that TGF-B1 down-regulates ANCR expression by increasing HDAC3 enrichment at ANCR promoter region, which decreases both H3 and H4 acetylation of ANCR promoter. In addition, by western blot and transwell assays, we indicate that ectopic expression of ANCR partly attenuates the TGF-B1-induced EMT. Downstream, ANCR inhibits breast cancer cell migration and breast cancer metastasis by decreasing RUNX2 expression in vitro and in vivo. Thus, our study identifies ANCR, as a new TGF-B downstream molecular, is essential for TGF-B1-induced EMT by decreasing RUNX2 expression. These results implicate that ANCR might become a prognostic biomarker and an anti-metastasis therapy target for breast cancer. These results demonstrate that ANCR is down-regulated during the TGF-B1-induced EMT in MCF10A cells. 	28978036	2017	LncRNA ANCR down-regulation promotes TGF-B-induced EMT and metastasis in breast cancer.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

In addition to linear isoforms, we identified circular forms of ANRIL (circANRIL). Further characterisation of circANRIL in two patient-derived metastatic melanoma cell lines (NZM7 and NZM37) revealed the existence of a rich  assortment of circular isoforms. Moreover, in the two melanoma cell lines investigated, the complements of circANRIL isoforms were almost completely different. Novel exons were also discovered. We also found the family of linear ANRIL was enriched in the nucleus, whilst the circular isoforms were enriched in  the cytoplasm and they differed markedly in stability. With respect to the variable processing of circANRIL species, bioinformatic analysis indicated that intronic Arthrobacter luteus (Alu) restriction endonuclease inverted repeats and  exon skipping were not involved in selection of back-spliced exon junctions. Based on our findings, we hypothesise that ANRIL has wholly distinct dual sets  of functions in melanoma.

In addition, BGC823/DDP and BGC823/5-FU cells transfected with ANRIL siRNA and treated with cisplatin or 5-FU, respectively, exhibited significant lower survival rate, decreased invasion capability, and high percentage of apoptotic tumor cells. The influence of ANRIL knockdown on MDR was assessed by measuring IC50 of BGC823/DDP and BGC823/5-FU cells to cisplatin and 5-FU, the result showed that silencing ANRIL decreased the IC50 values in gastric cancer cells.

MTT, colony formation and transwell and western bot assays were performed to demonstrate the specific impacts of ASAP1-IT1 on proliferation, migration and EMT progression of Cholangiocarcinoma Cells. As a results, the Cholangiocarcinoma progression was inhibited. Hedgehog signaling pathway has been discovered to be a treatment target in Cholangiocarcinoma. In this study, the interaction between ASAP1-IT1 and hedgehog pathway was specifically investigated. Smo and Gli1, two hedgehog-related proteins were examined in Cholangiocarcinoma cells. The results of qRT-PCR and western blot assay suggested that ASAP1-IT1 could positively modulate Smo and Gli1 in Cholangiocarcinoma.

Remarkable down-regulation of BTG3 has been reported in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). In the present study, a number of single-stranded modified anti-sense DNA oligonucleotides (antago) were designed, synthesized and screened for specific lncRNA ASBEL knockdown. We showed here that anti-ASBEL antago played a significant tumor suppressive role in TNBC by effective down-regulation of lncRNA ASBEL, which in turn led to increased BTG3 expression. The obtained data suggest lncRNA ASBEL as a novel therapeutic target in TNBC. antago3 has a great potential to be an useful therapeutic tool for TNBC treatment through targeting lncRNA ASBEL-related pathway.	28552529	2017	Targeting long non-coding RNA ASBEL with oligonucleotide antagonist for breast cancer therapy	0	1	1	0	0	0	0

MiR-532-5p overexpression inhibited GC metastasis and angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo,whereas miR-532-5p silencing had the opposite effect. Further study showed that miR-532-5p attenuated NF-kB signaling by directly inhibiting NCF2 expression, while miR-532-5p silencing in GC enhanced NF-kB activity. Furthermore,we demonstrated miR-532-5p down-regulation was caused by aberrantly high expression of LINC01410 in GC. Mechanistically, overexpression of LINC01410 promoted GC angiogenesis and metastasis by binding to and suppressing miR-532-5p, which resulted in up-regulation of NCF2 and sustained NF-kB pathway activation.Interestingly, NCF2 could in turn increase the promoter activity and expression of LINC01410 via NF-kB, thus forming a positive feedback loop that drives the malignant behavior of GC. For instance, lncRNA HCP5 up-regulates expression of Runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) in glioma cells, while overexpression of RUNX1 can also up-regulate HCP expression.	29483646	2018	LINC01410-miR-532-NCF2-NF-kB feedback loop promotes gastric cancer angiogenesis and metastasis.	0	0	1	1	0	0	0

Furthermore, BC005927 is frequently upregulated in GC samples and increased BC005927 expression was correlated with a higher tumor-node-metastasis stage. GC patients with higher BC005927 expression had poorer prognoses than those with lower expression. Additional experiments showed that BC005927 expression is induced by hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1a); CThis lncRNA is a direct transcriptional target of HIF-1a. Next, we found that EPHB4, a metastasis-related gene, is regulated by BC005927 and that the expression of EPHB4 was positively correlated with that of BC005927  in the clinical GC samples assessed. Intriguingly, EPHB4 expression was also increased under hypoxia, and its upregulation by BC005927 resulted in hypoxia-induced GC cell metastasis. These results advance the current understanding of the role of BC005927 in the regulation of hypoxia signaling and offer new avenues for the development of therapeutic interventions against cancer progression.  	29383777	2018	Long noncoding RNA BC005927 upregulates EPHB4 and promotes gastric cancer metastasis under hypoxia.    	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

Mechanistically, BC032469 could directly bind to miR-1207-5p and effectively functioned as a sponge for miR-1207-5p to modulate the derepression of hTERT. Thus, BC032469 may function as a ceRNA to impair miR-1207-5p-dependent hTERT downregulation, suggesting that it may be clinically valuable as a poor prognostic biomarker of gastric cancer.	26549025	2015	Long noncoding RNA BC032469, a novel competing endogenous RNA, upregulates hTERT expression by sponging miR-1207-5p and promotes proliferation in gastric cancer.	0	0	1	1	0	0	0

Knockdown of BC200 inhibited proliferation of HCT-116 and HT29 colon cancer cell lines and reduce the expression of cell proliferation markers, such as Ki-67 and PCNA. In addition, silencing of BC200 could induce obvious G0/G1 arrest and cause apoptosis in HCT-116 and HT29 cells and reduced the expression of cyclin D1, cyclin E, and c-Myc through inhibiting the expression of B-catenin. Importantly, we found that knockdown of BC200 reduced invasion of HCT-116 and HT29 cells and epithelial-mesenchymal transition  (EMT) by reducing the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9. Mechanistically, silencing of BC200 significantly reduced the phosphorylation of STAT3. Overall, the findings presented here suggest that lncRNA BC200 may serve as a novel oncogene and a new therapeutic target for colon cancer. 	29625226	2018	Long noncoding RNA BC200 regulates cell growth and invasion in colon cancer.	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

This elevated expression was critical for the survival of proliferating cancerous and non-cancerous cells, but is dispensable upon senescence or cell cycle arrest. Our knock-down assays challenge reports that BC200 knockdown confers a survival advantage, as we clearly demonstrate growth arrest and induction of apoptosis in a broad spectrum of both cancer and normal primary cells.

Furthermore, combining experiments of miR-144 and BLACAT1 indicated that miR-144 could reverse the function of BLACAT1 on NSCLC cells' phenotype. Overall, this study reveals the overexpression of BLACAT1 in NSCLC tissue and cells, and discovers the oncogenic role of BLACAT1 in NSCLC genesis through sponging miR-144, providing a potential biomarker for early detection and prognosis prediction of NSCLC.	28885863	2017	Long Noncoding RNA Bladder Cancer Associated Transcript 1 Promotes the Proliferation, Migration, and Invasion of Nonsmall Cell Lung Cancer Through Sponging miR-144	0	0	1	1	0	0	0

Moreover, patients with high BLACAT12 expression had shorter overall survival and progression-free survival time than those with low BLACAT1 expression, with the data provided by multivariate analysis suggesting that BLACAT1 expression could serve as an independent prognostic factor in CC patients. Functionally, in vitro assay indicated that down-regulation of BLACAT1 significantly suppressed CC cells proliferation, migration, and invasion.

The proliferation phenotype upon overexpression is observed only with CASIMO1 protein expression, but not with a non-translatable mutant attributing the effects to the sORF-derived protein rather than a lncRNA function. CASIMO1 microprotein interacts with squalene epoxidase (SQLE), a key enzyme in cholesterol synthesis and a known oncogene in breast cancer. Overexpression of CASIMO1 leads to SQLE protein accumulation without affecting its RNA levels and increased lipid droplet clustering, while knockdown of CASIMO1 decreased SQLE protein abundance and ERK phosphorylation downstream of SQLE. Importantly, SQLE knockdown mimicked the CASIMO1 knockdown phenotype and in turn SQLE overexpression fully rescued the effect of CASIMO1 knockdown.	29765154	2018	The cancer-associated microprotein CASIMO1 controls cell proliferation and interacts with squalene epoxidase modulating lipid droplet formation.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

MiR-181a-5p was a direct target of CCAT1, and repression of miR-181a-5p could rescue the inhibition of CCAT1 knockdown on MM progression. In addition,CCAT1 positively regulated HOXA1 expression through sponging miR-181a-5p in MM cells. lncRNA CCAT1 exerted an oncogenic role in MM by acting as a ceRNA of miR-181a-5p.

By gain- and loss-of-function analysis, we determined that CCAT1 repressed monocytic differentiation and promoted cell growth of HL-60 by sequestering tumor suppressive miR-155. Accordingly, a significant decrease in miR-155 level was detected in AML patients. Re-introduction of miR-155 into HL-60 cells restored monocytic maturation and repressed cell proliferation. Furthermore, CCAT1 could up-regulated c-Myc via its competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) activity on miR-155. In conclusion, these results revealed new mechanism of lncRNA CCAT1 in AML development, and suggested that the manipulation of CCAT1 expression could serve as a potential strategy in AML therapy.	26923190	2016	Long Non-Coding RNA CCAT1 Acts as a Competing Endogenous RNA to Regulate Cell Growth and Differentiation in Acute Myeloid Leukemia	0	0	1	1	0	0	0

Moreover, CCAT1 could negatively regulate miR-148b expression. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-148b suppressed colony survival fraction and caspase3 expression under irradiation in breast cancer cells, which was exacerbated by CCAT1 knockdown.	29024383	2017	Down-regulation of LncRNA CCAT1 enhances radiosensitivity via regulating miR-148b in breast cancer.	0	0	1	1	0	0	0

Interestingly, miR-490 can also repress CCAT1 expression. CCAT1 expression was significantly upregulated, and miR-490 expression was downregulated in GC. The negative correlation between miR-490 and CCAT1 expression was observed in GC tissues. Importantly, CCAT1 contains a putative miR-490-binding site, and deletion of this binding site abolishes their miR-490 responsiveness. Post-transcriptional CCAT1 silencing by miR-490 significantly suppressed GC cell migration. Furthermore, miR-490 directly bound to the hnRNPA1 mRNA 3'-UTR to repress its translation. Inhibition of miR-490 rescued CCAT1 siRNA-mediated suppression of cell migration. hnRNPA1 expression was significantly upregulated in GC specimens, and there was a negative correlation between miR-490 and hnRNPA1 expression and also a positive correlation between hnRNAP1 expression level and CCAT1 level	26825578	2016	The long noncoding RNA colon cancer-associated transcript-1/miR-490 axis regulates gastric cancer cell migration by targeting hnRNPA1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

After inhibiting CCAT1 expression in glioma cell line U251 with siRNA-CCAT1 (si-CCAT1), the cell viability and cell colony formation were decreased, the cell cycle was arrested in G1 phase, and the cell apoptosis was increased. After up-regulating CCAT1 expression in U251 cells, miR-410 level was decreased. Luciferase reporter assay confirmed that CCAT1 targeted miR-410.

Besides, high expression of CARLo-5 was associated with liver cirrhosis, tumor number, vascular invasion, capsular formation and Edmondson-Steiner grade, which proved that CARLo-5 was an independent risk factor for overall survival and disease-free survival. In addition, in highly metastatic HCC cell lines (HCCLM3 and MHCC97-L), CARLo-5 was up-regulated, but in lowly metastatic HCC cell lines (HepG2, SNU387), it showed down-regulated. Besides, by using gain and loss of function experiments in HCC cell lines (HCCLM3 and HepG2), the results showed that CARLo-5 overexpression significantly enhanced cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro.

While CCAT1 downregulation inhibited EOC cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition(EMT), migration and invasion, CCAT1 upregulation promoted EOC cell EMT, migration and invasion. We further identified and confirmed that miR-152 and miR-130b were the targets of CCAT1, and CCAT1 functioned by targeting miR-152 and miR-130b. Subsequently, ADAM17 and WNT1, and STAT3 and ZEB1 were confirmed to be the targets of miR-152 and miR-130b, respectively, and could be regulated by CCAT1 in EOC cells. Knockdown of anyone of these four proteins inhibited EOC cell EMT, migration and invasion. Taken together, our study first revealed a critical role of CCAT1-miR-152/miR-130b-ADAM17/WNT1/STAT3/ZEB1 regulatory network in EOC cell metastasis.

Among these, high expression of CCAT1 and CCAT2 was significantly associated with poor RFS (P=0.049 and 0.022, respectively) and OS (P=0.028 and 0.015, respectively). These results were validated in an independent patient cohort, in which combined expression of CCAT1 and CCAT2 expression was significantly associated with a poor RFS (HR:2.60, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04-6.06, P=0.042) and a poor OS (HR:8.38, 95%CI: 2.68-37.0,<0.001).High expression of CCAT1 and CCAT2 significantly associates with poor RFS and OS.

There was highly correlated for CCAT1, HOTAIR and lincRNA-p21 in plasma and serum. By receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis, plasma CCAT1 provided the higher diagnostic performance for detection of CRC. Moreover, CCAT1 combining with HOTAIR could provide a more effective diagnosis performance. Most importantly, this combination was effective to detect CRC at an early stage (85%). In conclusion, our results demonstrated that increased plasma HOTAIR and CCAT1 could be used as a predictive biomarker for CRC screening, and that combination of HOTAIR and CCAT1 had a higher positive diagnostic rate of CRC than HOTAIR or CCAT1 alone	26823726	2016	Combined identification of long non-coding RNA CCAT1 and HOTAIR in serum as an effective screening for colorectal carcinoma	0	1	1	0	0	0	0

In present study, differential expression of CCAT1, miR-410 and ITPKB were detected in colon cancer tissues and adjacent parts. Then the prediction programs were applied to predict the target genes of miR-410. The complementary bindings of miR-410 with lnc CCAT1 and ITPKB were assessed by luciferase assays. The interaction between LncRNA CCAT1 and miR-410 was analyzed. In addition, the mRNA and protein of ITPKB and apoptosis factors were examined in cells after miR-410 overexpression or silencing. Meanwhile, MTT and flow cytometer were used to detect the cells proliferation and apoptosis level. Results showed that CCAT1 and miR-410 were up-regulated in colon cancer tissues, but ITPKB was down-regulated. Lnc CCAT1 and ITPKB were predicted to be the targets of miR-410 and the prediction were verified by luciferase assays. The expression of lnc CCAT1 and ITPKB were inhibited by miR-410 in human HCT-116/ HCT-8 cells. Meanwhile, lnc CCAT1 could lead to a decrease of miR-410.

CCAT2 with high expression level was correlated with poor differentiation, higher T stage, and clinical stage, which made CCAT2 to be a prognostic biomarker in oral squamous cell carcinoma. LiCl-activated Wnt/B-catenin signaling pathway could partly restore the CCAT2-mediated malignant biological behaviors of oral squamous cell carcinoma cells by suppressing B-catenin, CCND1, and MYC and activating glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta expression. However,  CCAT2 expression was not associated with other parameters  such as gender ( p = 0.5057), age ( p = 0.8907), smoking  ( p = 0.2778), drinking ( p = 0.5626), position ( p = 0.1337), and  N stage ( p = 0.1138) in OSCC (Table 1).

Knockout of CCAT2 increases miR-145 and negatively regulates miR-21 in HCT-116 cells, impairs proliferation and differentiation. In contrast, stable up-regulation of CCAT2 decreases mature miR-145 and increases the expression of several CSC markers in colon cancer cells. We have also observed that CCAT2 is enriched in the nucleus and correlates with the expression of pre-miR-145 but not pre-miR-21 in HCT-116 cells.

Furthermore, silencing of CCAT2 gene inhibited the proliferation of BGC-823 cells, as well as induced apoptosis and autophagy in BGC-823 cells, by suppression of the PI3K/mTOR signaling pathways.Recent studies confirmed that the lncRNA CCAT2, located at the 8q24 amplicon of the cancer risk-associated rs6983267 SNP, regulated the cancer metabolism in vitro and in vivo by directly interacting in an allele-specific manner with a protein complex. The chromosomal region 8q24 emerged as an important region for genetic susceptibility in various cancer types, thus DNA methylation or SNPs at this locus may contribute to cancer risk. RT-qPCR results revealed that CCAT2 gene expression was effectively suppressed by the transfection, while POU domain class 5 transcription factor 1B (POU5F1B) gene expression was significantly decreased. 	29435046	2017	Effect of silencing colon cancer-associated transcript 2 on the proliferation,apoptosis and autophagy of gastric cancer BGC-823 cells.	0	0	1	0	1	1	1

By inducing or silencing CRNDE expression, we detected a positive correlation between CRNDE levels and the proliferative, migratory, and invasive capacities of glioma cells, which were concomitant with a decreased apoptosis rate. Our experiments also suggest that these effects are mediated by downregulation of miR-136-5p, which correlated with the glioma WHO grade. Based on predicted CRNDE/miR-136-5p/mRNA interactions, both the mRNA and protein expression analyses suggested that miR-136-5p-mediated repression of Bcl-2 and Wnt2 underlies the pro-tumoral actions of CRNDE. We therefore propose that CRNDE functions as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) that binds to and negatively regulates miR-136-5p, thereby protecting Bcl-2 and Wnt2 from miR-136-5p-mediated inhibition in glioma.	29152149	2017	The long non-coding RNA CRNDE acts as a ceRNA and promotes glioma malignancy by preventing miR-136-5p-mediated downregulation of Bcl-2 and Wnt2	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

CRNDE overexpression facilitated cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while inhibited glioma cells apoptosis. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) demonstrated that miR-384 was downregulated in human glioma tissues and glioma cell lines. Moreover, restoration of miR-384 exerted tumor-suppressive functions. In addition, the expression of miR-384 was negatively correlated with CRNDE expression. A binding region between CRNDE and miR-384 was confirmed using luciferase assays. Moreover, CRNDE promoted cell malignant behavior by decreasing miR-384 expression. At the molecular level, treatment by CRNDE knockdown or miR-384 overexpression resulted in a decrease of piwi-like RNA-mediated gene silencing 4 (PIWIL4) protein. Besides, PIWIL4 was identified as a target of miR-384 and plays an oncogenic role in glioma. Similarly, downstream proteins of PIWIL4 such as STAT3, cyclin D1, VEGFA, SLUG, MMP-9, caspase 3, Bcl-2, and bcl-xL were modulated when treated with miR-384 and PIWIL4. Remarkably, CRNDE knockdown combined with miR-384 overexpression led to tumor regression in vivo.	27049681	2016	CRNDE Promotes Malignant Progression of Glioma by Attenuating miR-384/PIWIL4/STAT3 Axis	0	0	1	1	0	0	0

Overexpression of miR-186 exerted functions of inhibiting the proliferation, migration and invasion of GSCs and promoting apoptosis. And CRNDE decreased the expression levels of XIAP and PAK7 by binding to miR-186 and negatively regulating it. In addition, miR-186 binded to XIAP and PAK7 3'UTR region, and decrease the expression of them, thus regulating the expression levels of downstream target proteins such as caspase 3, BAD, cyclin D1 and MARK2.	26231038	2015	CRNDE affects the malignant biological characteristics of human glioma stem cells by negatively regulating miR-186.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

In conclusion, our results reveal that DANCR function as competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for miR-34c and miR-613 to modulate progression and metastasis in RB oncogenesis via targeting MMP-9, presenting the in-depth regulation of DANCR in RB and providing a novel insight for ceRNA mechanism for RB. 	29744877	2018	Long noncoding RNA DANCR aggravates retinoblastoma through miR-34c and miR-613 by targeting MMP-9.	0	0	1	1	0	0	0

Functional experiments illustrated that a depression of DANCR suppressed ROCK1-mediated proliferation and metastasis in osteosarcoma cells. The results of western blot assays and qRT-PCR assays revealed that DANCR regulated ROCK1 via crosstalk with miR-335-5p and miR-1972. Further cellular behavioral experiments demonstrated that DNACR promoted ROCK1-meidated proliferation and metastasis through decoying both miR-335-5p and miR-1972. Finally, the outcomes of in vivo animal models showed that DANCR promoted tumor growth and lung metastasis of osteosarcoma.

Moreover, pull-down assays and luciferase reporter assays indicated that DANCR upregulated expression of the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL by competitively binding to miR-33a-5p. Furthermore, DANCR enhanced the expression of proteins downstream of the AXL-Akt pathway. DANCR was consistently significantly increased in osteosarcoma tissues, and its expression was positively correlated with tumor size and metastasis as an independent poor prognostic factor. Furthermore, both in patient tumors and xenograft tumors, DANCR expression was positively related to AXL and negatively related to miR-33a-5p. Taken together, our results suggest that DANCR is a crucial upregulator of osteosarcoma and an independent predictor of prognosis.

Additionally,a novel microRNA target of DGCR5,hsa-mir-22-3p was identified through bioinformatics search and confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter system. Gain and loss-of-function studies were performed to verify whether DGCR5 exerts its biological functions through regulating hsa-mir-22-3p in vitro. Overexpression of DGCR5 was able to reverse the tumor inhibitory effect of hsa-mir-22-3p mimics. Furthermore, in vivo tests tumor xenografts were established to detect the function of DGCR5 in LUAD tumorigenesis. Downregulated DGCR5 expression was greatly associated with smaller tumor size,implying a favorable prognosis of LUAD patients.Taken these together,DGCR5 could be considered as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in LUAD diagnosis and treatment. 	29030962	2018	LncRNA DGCR5 promotes lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) progression via inhibiting hsa-mir-22-3p.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

Moreover, compared to Ishikawa and KLE, lncRNA DLEU1 was higher in HEC-1B. In addition, Up-regulation of lncRNA DLEU1 promoted cell viability, migration, invasion and reduced the proportion of apoptosis. Otherwise, Down-regulation of lncRNA DLEU1 produced opposite results. Xenograft nude mice model assay showed that lncRNA DLEU1 can promote tumorigenesis in vivo. RiP confirmed that lncRNA DLEU1 could bind to mTOR. The rescue experiments revealed that silence of mTOR after up-regulation of lncRNA DLEU1 resulted in decrease of cell viability, migration and invasion and increase of apoptosis. The expression changes of PI3K, AKT1, p70S6K, rpS6, GSK3B, STAT3 and Bcl-xl were consistent with lncRNA DLEU1 and mTOR  in western blot.

We validated the enrichment of apoERa, p300, GATA3, FoxM1 and CTCF at both DSCAM-AS1 TSS and at its associated SE by ChIP-qPCR. Furthermore, by analyzing MCF-7 ChIA-PET data and by 3C assays, we confirmed long range chromatin interaction between the SE and the DSCAM-AS1 TSS.

Knockdown of lincDUSP in patient-derived colon tumor cell lines resulted in significantly decreased cell proliferation and clonogenic potential, and increased susceptibility to apoptosis. The knockdown of lincDUSP affects the expression of  ~800 genes, and NCI pathway analysis showed enrichment of DNA damage response and cell cycle control pathways. Further, identification of lincDUSP chromatin occupancy sites by ChIRP-Seq demonstrated association with genes involved in the  replication-associated DNA damage response and cell cycle control. Consistent with these findings, lincDUSP knockdown in colon tumor cell lines increased both  the accumulation of cells in early S-phase and γH2AX foci formation, indicating increased DNA damage response induction. Taken together, these results demonstrate a key role of lincDUSP in the regulation of important pathways in colon cancer. 	29743621	2018	Colon Cancer-Upregulated Long Non-Coding RNA lincDUSP Regulates Cell Cycle Genes and Potentiates Resistance to Apoptosis.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

DUXAP10,a pseudogene derived long non-coding RNA(lncRNA), is overexpression in colorectal cancer (CRC). DUXAP10 was up-regulated in CRC tissues which was positively correlated with advanced pathological stages, larger tumor sizes and lymph node metastasis. Additionally, knockdown of DUXAP10 inhibited cell proliferation, induced cell apoptosis and increase the number of G0/G1 cells significantly in the HCT116 and SW480 cell lines. Moreover, DUXAP10 silencing inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Further mechanism study showed that, by binding to histone demethylase lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), DUXAP10 promote CRC cell growth and reduced cell apoptosis through silencing the expression of p21 and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) tumor suppressor. Our findings suggested that the pseudogene-derived from lncRNA DUXAP10 promotes the biological progression of CRC and is likely to be a potential therapeutic target for CRC intervention.	28779166	2017	The pseudogene derived from long non-coding RNA DUXAP10 promotes colorectal cancer cell growth through epigenetically silencing of p21 and PTEN.	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

Bioinformatic analysis showed that cell cycle progression was increased in patients with high DUXAP10 expression. In vitro and in vivo assays of DUXAP10 alterations revealed a complex integrated phenotype affecting cell growth, apoptosis, migration, and invasion. Mechanistic studies revealed that DUXAP10 has a crucial role in G2/M arrest. We further showed that DUXAP10 regulated PC cell proliferation through interact with RNA-binding protein EZH2 and LSD1.

In the appropriate context, sensitivity could be recapitulated through EGFR-AS1 knockdown in vitro and in vivo, whereas overexpression was sufficient to induce resistance to TKIs. Reduced EGFR-AS1 levels shifted splicing toward EGFR isoform D, leading to ligand-mediated pathway activation. In co-clinical trials involving patients and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, tumor shrinkage was most pronounced in the context of the A/A genotype for EGFR-Q787Q, low expression of EGFR-AS1 and high expression of EGFR isoform D.

It was initially found that the relative transcription level of EGOT in glioma cancerous tissues was signifcantly lower than that in adjacent non-cancerous tissues. EGOT was differentially expressed in a series of glioma cell lines, with its lowest level in high aggressive U251 and U87 cells. When EGOT was overexpressed by an expression plasmid, cell viability was significantly inhibited in U251 and U87 cells. Furthermore, with EGOT overexpression, the cell cycle was arrested at G0/G1 phase and consequently, cell apoptosis was signifcantly promoted along with the activities of caspase-3 and caspase-9. The migration abilities of EGOT-overexpressed cells were inhibited by 71.4% in U251 cells and by 69.5% in U87 cells. These data suggest that overexpression of EGOT inhibits cell proliferation and migration, and promotes cell apoptosis in glioma.

Clinical data suggest that ENST01108 is closely associated with the malignant status in glioma. In vitro experiment demonstrated that overexpression of ENST01108 promoted glioma cell proliferation, migration, invasion, EMT process and survival, while knockdown of ENST01108 has an opposite effect,indicating that ENST01108 serves as an oncogenic property in glioma carcinogenesis.Further, we identified miR-489 as a direct target of ENST01108 and ENST01108 negatively regulate miR-489 by act as a sponge. SIK1 is verified as the direct target of miR-489 and it is negatively regulated by miR-489. ENST01108 also positively regulate SIKI and it promotes SIKI expression by suppressing miR-489.

Low EPB41L4A-AS2 expression was determined,and overexpression of this gene inhibited cell migration and invasion in the EMT model. Moreover, EPB41L4A-AS2 suppressed TGFBR1 expression.A major mechanism of lncRNAs in regulating gene expression involves the interaction with Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which catalyzes the trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) to repress the transcription of specific genes. Considering that the promoter region of TGFBR1 is rich in methylation, we hypothesized that EPB41L4A-AS2 plays a role in inducing the methylation of the TGFBR1 promoter. Competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) is currently under intense study as a novel mechanism for lncRNA functions, which indicates that RNA transcripts communicate with one another by miRNA response elements. 	29490660	2018	Identification and validation a TGF-B-associated long non-coding RNA of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma by bioinformatics method.	0	0	1	0	0	0	1

This entailed conducting a meta-analysis and prognosis validation study using two cohorts from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). In addition, we assessed EPB41L4A-AS2 expression and its relationship with the clinicopathological features of renal and lung cancers using the Cancer Genome Atlas cohort and a GEO dataset. We also clarified the role of EPB41L4A-AS2 expression in mediating cancer cell proliferation in breast, renal, and lung cancer cell lines transfected with an EPB41L4A-AS2 expression vector. We found that high EPB41L4A-AS2 expression is associated with favorable disease outcomes.

EPEL knockdown specifically down-regulated the expression of cell cyclerelated E2F target genes, including Cyclin B1 (CCNB1), in lung cancer cells but not that of apoptosis- or metabolism-related E2F target genes. EPEL interacted with E2F1 and regulated the expression of the E2F target genes by changing the binding efficiency of E2F1 to the E2F target promoters.

EPIC1 knockdown reduces the occupancy of MYC to its target genes (e.g., CDKN1A, CCNA2, CDC20, and CDC45).

Mechanistically, antisense lncRNA EZR-AS1 formed a complex with RNA polymerase II to activate the transcription of EZR. Moreover, EZR-AS1 could recruit SMYD3 to a binding site, present in a GC-rich region downstream of the EZR promoter, causing the binding of SMYD3 and local enrichment of H3K4me3. Finally, the interaction of EZR-AS1 with SMYD3 further enhanced EZR transcription and expression. Our findings suggest that antisense lncRNA EZR-AS1, as a member of an RNA polymerase complex and through enhanced SMYD3-dependent H3K4 methylation, plays an important role in enhancing transcription of the EZR gene to promote the mobility and invasiveness of human cancer cells.EZR-AS1 regulates EZR transcriptional activity in ESCC cells by interacting with RNA polymerase II, but not by affecting the binding of SP1 and AP-1 transcription factors. the overexpression of EZR-AS1 accompanied the enhanced expression of EZR (variant 1), both at the mRNA and protein levels, in KYSE150 cells (Figure 1H and I). 	29253179	2018	The interaction of lncRNA EZR-AS1 with SMYD3 maintains overexpression of EZR in ESCC cells.	0	0	0	0	1	1	1

The disease-free survival and overall survival of OS patients were not correlated with age, gender and tumor location, but remarkably correlated with FOXP4-AS1 expression, tumor size and lung metastasis. For in vitro experiments, MG63?cells expressed a higher expression of FOXP4-AS1, whereas U2OS cells expressed a lower  expression, which were selected for the following studies. Overexpressed FOXP4-AS1 led to enhanced proliferation, migration and invasion, shortened G0/G1  phase, as well as inhibited cell cycle. Knockdown of FOXP4-AS1 in MG63?cells obtained the opposite results. Furthermore, RIP assay indicated that FOXP4-AS1 could inhibit LATS1 expression by binding to LSD1 and EZH2, so as to participate  in OS development. In conclusion, these results revealed that FOXP4-AS1 is overexpressed in OS, and is the independent risk factor in OS prognosis. Upregulated FOXP4-AS1 promotes the proliferation, migration and cell cycle, but inhibits apoptosis of OS cells.

Interleukin-33 (IL-33) was mainly located in the stroma and positively co-expressed with Lnc-CAF to elevate the expression of CAF markers (a-SMA, vimentin and N-cadherin) in fibroblasts. In a co-culture system, IL-33 knockdown  impaired Lnc-CAF-mediated stromal fibroblast activation, leading to decreased proliferation of tumor cells. Mechanistically, Lnc-CAF up-regulated IL-33 levels  and prevented p62-dependent autophagy-lysosome degradation of IL-33, which was independent of LncRNA-protein scaffold effects. Treatment with the autophagy inducer, rapamycin, impaired the proliferative effect of Lnc-CAF/IL-33 by promoting IL-33 degradation.

Mechanistically, FOXD2-AS1 forms an RNA-DNA complex with the promoter of TRIB3, the transcriptional activity of which is subsequently repressed, and leads to the activation of Akt, which further increases the expression of E2F1, a vital transcription factor involved in the G/S transition. Interestingly, E2F1 could bind to the FOXD2-AS1 promoter region and subsequently enhance its transcriptional activity, indicating that FOXD2-AS1/Akt/E2F1 forms a feedback loop.	29445134	2018	Human NPC cell lines CNE2 and 5-8FThe long non-coding RNA FOXD2-AS1 promotes bladder cancer progression and recurrence through a positive feedback loop with Akt and E2F1.	0	0	1	0	0	1	0

In conclusion, rs55829688 polymorphism could increase GAS5 expression by interacting with TP63, which might aggravate the myelosuppression and in turn lead to poor prognosis in AML. GAS5 is observed to be a key mediator of glucocorticoids (GCs) resistance rather than a growth arrest-specific transcript in PBMCs.	27951730	2017	Long non-coding RNA GAS5 polymorphism predicts a poor prognosis of acute myeloid leukemia in Chinese patients via affecting hematopoietic reconstitution.	1	1	1	0	1	0	0

We demonstrate that GAS5 suppresses GSC malignancy by binding to miR-196a-5p. miR-196a-5p, an onco-miRNA, stimulates GSC proliferation, migration, and invasion, in addition to reducing levels of apoptosis. miR-196a-5p specifically downregulates the expression of forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) by targeting its 3′ untranslated region (3′-UTR). FOXO1 upregulates expression of phosphotyrosine interaction domain containing 1 (PID1), thereby inhibiting GSC tumorigenicity and growth. FOXO1 also upregulates migration and invasion inhibitory protein(MIIP), resulting in attenuation of migration and invasion activities. Interestingly, we also show that FOXO1 promotes GAS5 transcription, thus forminga positive feedback loop.	28666797	2017	GAS5 suppresses malignancy of human glioma stem cells via a miR-196a-5p/FOXO1 feedback loop	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

In summary, we demonstrated that SNP rs145204276 of GAS5 was associated with decreased risk of lung cancer in the Chinese populations.

HCC patients with higher levels of GAS5 or with the lower levels of miR-21 have longer survival times. There are lower levels of GAS5 and higher levels of miR-21 in HCC cell lines (Be7402, SMMC-7721, and HCCLM3) than in normal liver L-02 cells, and the levels correlate with the aggression of the HCC cell lines. Knockdown of GAS5 upregulates miR-21 levels in Bel-7402 cells (weakly aggressive). Moreover, GAS5 that upregulated or downregulated the expression of PDCD4 and PTEN was reversed by inhibiting or overexpressing miR-21 level in Bel-7402 and HCCLM3 cells. Then, overexpression of GAS5 suppresses the migration and invasion of HCC cells and high expression of miR-21 largely eliminates GAS5-mediated suppression of HCC cell migration and invasion.	26404135	2015	Long noncoding RNA GAS5 suppresses the migration and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma cells via miR-21.	0	0	1	1	0	0	0

While the LncRNA GAS5 expression in tissues, plasma and exosomes were associated with the tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage,Dukes stage,lymph node metastasis (LNM),local recurrence rate and distant metastasis rate,the MiR-221 expression in tissues, plasma and exosomes were associated with tumor size, TNM stage, Dukes stage, LNM, local recurrence rate and distant metastasis rate.LncRNA GAS5 and miR-221 expression in tissues, plasma and exosomes were found to be independent prognostic factors for CRC.

Collectively,these observations suggest that overexpression of PTENP1-AS and GAS5 in gastric cancer could be abrogating oncogenic activity of miR-21 and confirms that lncRNAs could act as tumor suppressive ceRNAs.	29719612	2018	Comprehensive analysis of aberrantly expressed lncRNAs and construction of ceRNA  network in gastric cancer.  	0	0	1	1	0	0	0

GAS5 suppresses cancer proliferation by acting as a molecular sponge for miR-21, leading to the de-repression of phosphatase and tensin homologs (PTEN), the endogenous target of miR-21.

ChIP assay was conducted to determine the H3K27Ac acetylation of GHET1 promoter. H3K27 acetylation activated-GHET1 was upregulated in HCC tissues and cell lines. Moreover, GHET1 silencing could inhibit the proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT of HCC cells in vitro. GHET1 could regulate the expression of ATF1 mRNA and protein; RNA pull-down assays supported that GHET1 could bind to ATF1 protein.	28772210	2017	LncRNA GHET1 activated by H3K27 acetylation promotes cell tumorigenesis through regulating ATF1 in hepatocellular carcinoma	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

However, 2 sporadic cases demonstrated monoallelic expression of the IGF2 gene with inactivation of the H19 gene.

Since a growth-inhibitory activity has been found associated with the H19 gene, the extinction of its expression can contribute to RMS development. Parental imprinting of the H19 gene was found conserved in all informative RMSs, including those whose ICF-2 imprinting was relaxed, indicating that LOI is a gene-specific event. Seven ERMSs and one ARMS displaying low H19 RNA levels showed an underrepresentation of the expressed allele in their genotype. This result is consistent with the paternal imprinting of the H19 gene and with the preferential loss of the maternal 11p15 alleles in these neoplasms.	9136994	1997	Expression and parental imprinting of the H19 gene in human rhabdomyosarcoma.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Mechanistically, we identified seven miR-17-92 cluster binding sites on H19, and found that H19 directly bound to miR-17-92 cluster via these seven binding sites. Through binding to miR-17-92 cluster, H19 relieves the suppressing roles of miR-17-92 cluster on p21. Furthermore, H19 represses STAT3 activation induced by miR-17-92 cluster. Hence, our results revealed that H19 upregulates p21 expression,inhibits STAT3 phosphorylation, and downregulates the expression of STAT3 target genes BCL2, BCL2L1, and BIRC5. In conclusion, our data suggested that H19 inhibits retinoblastoma progression via counteracting the roles of miR-17-92 cluster, and implied that enhancing the action of H19 may be a promising therapeutic strategy for retinoblastoma.  	29143996	2017	Long non-coding RNA H19 suppresses retinoblastoma progression via counteracting miR-17-92 cluster.	0	0	1	1	1	0	0

Knockdown of H19 significantly inhibited the invasive ability of NPC cells. Moreover, H19 affected the expression of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), which has also been observed to be up-regulated in NPC and to promote cell invasion. Rather than direct interaction, H19 regulated EZH2 expression by suppressing the activity of miR-630, which is a repressor of EZH2 and interacts with H19 in a sequence-specific manner.

H19 knockdown significantly reduced the proliferation, migration and invasion ability of melanoma cells. H19 knockdown also inactivated the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway, which in turn inhibited the activation of the NF-kB signaling pathway.

In stroma cells, H19 frequency of expression was 75% in normal endometrium, 55% in hyperplasia, and 37% in carcinoma. According to the grade of endometrial cancer cell differentiation, H19 showed increased frequency and level of expression in the epithelium from well to moderately and poorly differentiated tissues. Our results indicate that H19 expression in epithelial cells of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer merits further investigation and could be useful as a complementary histopathologic and prognostic marker among other modalities in endometrial cancer.	15228427	2004	H19 and IGF2 gene expression in human normal, hyperplastic, and malignant endometrium.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Ten tumors were informative for both genes, of which four maintained the constitutional imprinting and six showed loss of imprinting at either H19 or IGF2. These data suggest that loss of imprinting at the IGF2 and H19 loci play a role in the oncogenesis of head and neck carcinoma.	10597307	1999	Frequent loss of imprinting at the IGF2 and H19 genes in head and neck squamous carcinoma.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Fourteen (48%) and 13 (45%) tumours were heterozygous for H19 and IGF2 respectively. LOH for H19 and IGF2 genes were found in 2 of 14 (14%) and 3 of 13 (23%) informative tumours, respectively. LOI of H19 and IGF2 was detected in 2 of 12 (17%) and 5 of 10 (50%) tumours with no LOH, respectively. More interestingly, monoallelic expression of the otherwise silent H19 allele (allele switch) was observed in 2 of 12 (17%) tumours and biallelic expression of IGF2 was detected in one specimen of normal cervix adjacent to the tumour. The expressing H19 allele, and to a lower degree also the silent allele, were hypomethylated in tumours suggesting that demethylation of both H19 alleles may be associated with an early step of imprinting alteration.	8570220	1996	High incidence of loss of heterozygosity and abnormal imprinting of H19 and IGF2 genes in invasive cervical carcinomas.

Overall, our findings may help to develop diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutics that target H19 for the treatment of CCA.

H19 and its associated miR-675 act as oncogenes by promoting cell growth and malignant transformation in human gastric cancer. The upregulation of H19 and miR-675 in GC suggests that both H19 and miR-675 are important factors in GC tumorigenesis and metastasis.

Conversely, silencing of H19 represses these BCSC properties. In concordance, knockdown of H19 markedly inhibits tumor growth and suppresses tumorigenesis in nude mice. Mechanistically, we found that H19 functions as a competing endogenous RNA to sponge miRNA let-7, leading to an increase in expression of a let-7 target, the core pluripotency factor LIN28, which is enriched in BCSC populations and breast patient samples.	28102845	2017	H19/let-7/LIN28 reciprocal negative regulatory circuit promotes breast cancer stem cell maintenance.	0	0	1	1	0	0	0

Moreover, 91H-knockdown reduces the expression of H19 and IGF2 in breast cancer cells.

Then the expressions of HCG11 and IGF2BP1 were both inhibited in the human HCC cell line HepG2 and the cell viability, proliferation, apoptosis and metastasis potential of HepG2 cells were assessed. At molecular level, the expression levels of p-ERK, p-JNK, p-p38, p21 and cleaved caspase-3 were also determined to explain the pathways involved in the function of HCG11 in the progression of HCC.

We further discovered that HNF1A-AS1 knockdown significantly inhibited cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth, suppressed S-phase entry, and inhibited cell migration and invasion in multiple in vitro EAC models. Our findings suggest that dysregulation of HNF1A-AS1 participates in oesophageal tumorigenesis, and that this participation may be mediated, at least in part, by modulation of chromatin and nucleosome assembly as well as by H19 induction.	24000294	2014	Long non-coding RNA HNF1A-AS1 regulates proliferation and migration in oesophageal adenocarcinoma cells.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Mechanistically, HOTAIR reduces the recuritment of the CREB, P300, RNA polII onto the SETD2 promoter region that inhibits SETD2 expression and its phosphorylation. Thereby, the SETD2 binding capacity to substrate histone H3 is weakened, triggering a reduction of trimethylation on histone H3 thirty-sixth lysine, and thereby the H3K36me3-hMSH2-hMSH6-SKP2 complex is also decreased	26172293	2015	LncRNA HOTAIR promotes human liver cancer stem cell malignant growth through downregulation of SETD2	0	0	0	0	0	0	1

The role of HOTAIR in melanoma cell motility and invasion was further evaluated by knocking down HOTAIR with siRNAs. Knockdown of HOTAIR resulted in the reduction of motility and invasion of human melanoma cell line A375, as assessed by wound healing assay and Matrigel-based invasion assay. siHOTAIR also suppressed the degradation of gelatin matrix, suggesting that HOTAIR promotes gelatinase activity.

Moreover, magnetic nanoparticle-mediated low expression of HOTAIR effectively reduced the tumorigenic capacity of glioma stem cells in vivo. In addition, the results of qRT-PCR and western blot analysis demonstrated that downregulation of HOTAIR expression significantly increased the expression of PDCD4 in GSCs, in addition to reducing the expression of CCND1 and CDK4.

We found that treatment with TGF-B1 resulted in increased Hotair expression and triggered the EMT program. Interestingly, ablation of Hotair expression by siRNA prevented the EMT program stimulated by TGF-B1, and also the colony-forming capacity of colon and breast cancer cells. Furthermore, we observed that the colon CSC subpopulation (CD133(+)/CD44(+)) presents much higher levels of Hotair when compared with the non-stem cell subpopulation.	24022994	2013	Brief report: The lincRNA Hotair is required for epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and stemness maintenance of cancer cell lines.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Moreover, functional analyses revealed that the knockdown of HOTTIP expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) or small hairpin RNA (shRNA) could inhibit cell proliferation and induce cell apoptosis. More importantly, we observed that HOTTIP knockdown induced a marked increase in the number of cells in the G0/G1 phase and a reduction in the number of cells in the S phase in both DLD-1 cells and SW480 cells. An in vivo experiment also revealed that the knockdown of HOTTIP inhibited tumor growth. Western blot and immunohistochemistry analyses indicated that HOTTIP potentially contributed to CRC cell growth partially through the silencing of p21 expression. 	26678886	2015	The long noncoding RNA HOXA transcript at the distal tip promotes colorectal cancer growth partially via silencing of p21 expression	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Interaction between miR-192 or miR-204 and HOTTIP were further confirmed using dual luciferase reporter gene assays. Consistent with this notion, a significant negative correlation between these miRNAs and HOTTIP exists in HCC tissue specimens. Interestingly, the dysregulation of the three ncRNAs was associated with overall survival of HCC patients. In addition, the posttranscriptional silencing of HOTTIP by miR-192, miR-204 or HOTTIP siRNAs could significantly suppress viability of HCC cells. On the contrary, antagonizing endogenous miR-192 or miR-204 led to increased HOTTIP expression and stimulated cell proliferation.	26710269	2015	MiRNA-192 [corrected] and miRNA-204 Directly Suppress lncRNA HOTTIP and Interrupt GLS1-Mediated Glutaminolysis in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.	0	0	1	1	0	0	0

Overexpression and knockdown studies of HOXA11-AS or PADI2, as well as gain-/loss-of-function studies of miR-125a-5p, revealed a positive correlation between HOXA11-AS and PADI2 and a negative correlation with miR-125a-5p in the regulation of liver metastasis in CRC cell lines. In this study, HOXA11-AS expression was up-regulated in the tissues of CRC patients with liver metastasis. The knockdown and overexpression of HOXA11-AS inhibited and promoted the migration and invasion of colon cancer cells, respectively. Moreover, we confirmed that HOXA11-AS functions as a ceRNA to regulate PADI2 expression by sponging miR-125a-5p. The HOXA11-AS/miR-125a-5p/PADI2 regulatory network may represent a novel therapeutic target for liver metastasis of CRC.	29050308	2017	The lncRNA HOXA11-AS functions as a competing endogenous RNA to regulate PADI2 expression by sponging miR-125a-5p in liver metastasis of colorectal cancer.	0	0	1	1	0	0	0

Knockdown of HOXA11-AS in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436 breast cancer cell lines inhibited the formation of cell colonies and arrested the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase. Depletion of HOXA11-AS using two specific short interfering (si)RNAs against HOXA11-AS (siHOXA11-AS-1 and siHOXA11-AS-2) additionally suppressed the cell proliferative rate. Furthermore, transwell assays and wound-healing analysis revealed that siRNA transfection inhibited cell migration and invasion by ~50% in the two cell lines. The results of the present study demonstrated the oncogenic role of HOXA11-AS in breast cancer, providing novel clues for the future clinical diagnosis and treatment of early stage breast cancer patients.	28791375	2017	Long non-coding RNA HOXA11-AS promotes cell proliferation and metastasis in human breast cancer	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Moreover, patients with high HOXA11-AS expression had a shorter survival and poorer prognosis than that of lower expression. Bioinformatics prediction forecast that miR-140-5p directly targeted HOXA11-AS at 3￠-UTR, which was confirmed by luciferase reporter assay. In vitro rescue experiment assays, miR-140-5p inhibitor transfection, could reverse the function of HOXA11-AS knockdown on the proliferation, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. Taken together, the present study illustrates that the pathway of HOXA11-AS sponging miR-140-5p might play a vital regulating role in the development and progression of glioma.	28832185	2017	Long Noncoding RNA HOXA11-AS Functions as miRNA Sponge to Promote the Glioma Tumorigenesis Through Targeting miR-140-5p	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

HOXA-AS2 knockdown significantly suppressed proliferation by blocking the G1/S transition and caused apoptosis of CRC cells in vitro and in vivo. The mechanistic investigations showed that HOXA-AS2 could interact with EZH2, LSD1 and recruit them to p21 (CDKN1A), KLF2 promoter regions to repress their transcription. Furthermore, the rescue experiments demonstrated that HOXA-AS2 oncogenic function is partly through regulating p21.	28112720	2017	Long noncoding RNA HOXA-AS2 represses P21 and KLF2 expression transcription by binding with EZH2, LSD1 in colorectal cancer.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The HOXB-AS3 peptide, not lncRNA, suppresses colon cancer (CRC) growth. Mechanistically, the HOXB-AS3 peptide competitively binds to the ariginine residues in RGG motif of hnRNP A1 and antagonizes the hnRNP A1-mediated regulation of pyruvate kinase M (PKM) splicing by blocking the binding of the ariginine residues in RGG motif of hnRNP A1 to the sequences flanking PKM exon 9, ensuring the formation of lower PKM2 and suppressing glucose metabolism reprogramming. CRC patients with low levels of HOXB-AS3 peptide have poorer prognoses. Our study indicates that the loss of HOXB-AS3 peptide is a critical oncogenic event in CRC metabolic reprogramming.	28985503	2017	A Peptide Encoded by a Putative lncRNA HOXB-AS3 Suppresses Colon Cancer Growth	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

Knockdown of HOXD-AS1 inhibited the proliferation and chemo-resistance of CRPC cells in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we identified several cell cycle, chemo-resistance, and castration-resistance- related genes, including PLK1, AURKA, CDC25C, FOXM1, and UBE2C, that were activated transcriptionally by HOXD-AS1. Further investigation revealed that HOXD-AS1 recruited WDR5 to directly regulate the expression of target genes by mediating histone H3 lysine 4 tri-methylation (H3K4me3). In conclusion, our finndings indicate that HOXD-AS1 promotes proliferation, castration resistance, and chemo-resistance in prostate cancer by recruiting WDR5.

Mechanistically, HOXD-AS1 functioned as a competing endogenous RNA for miR-217. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that HOXD-AS1 may promote CRC progression and metastasis by competing for miR-217.

H19 and HULC functioned as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) by sponging let-7a/let-7b and miR-372/miR-373, respectively, which activate pivotal inflammation cytokine IL-6 and chemokine receptor CXCR4. Our study revealed that H19 and HULC, up-regulated by oxidative stress, regulate CCA cell migration and invasion by targeting IL-6 and CXCR4 via ceRNA patterns of sponging let-7a/let-7b and miR-372/miR-373, respectively.	27809873	2016	LncRNAs H29 and HULC, activated by oxidative stress, promote cell migration and invasion in cholangiocarcinoma through a ceRNA manner	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

LncRNA-protein interactions were examined by ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays. We found that HULC expression levels were higher in EOC tissues than normal samples. HULC overexpression induced cell proliferation, migration, invasion, whereas reduced cell apoptosis in vitro and induced tumor growth in vivo. In contrast, downregulation of HULC by siRNA transfection reduced cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and induced cell apoptosis and autophagy. Our results showed that HULC overexpression reduced ATG7, LC3-II and LAMP1 expression, while inducing SQSTM1 (P62) and ITGB1 expression.

This process induced anoikis and blocked the cell cycle at G1/S phase via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, thus regulating the tumor-related genes involved in the above biological behavior in human glioma U87MG and U251 cells. However, these effects were reversed by ESM-1 overexpression, suggesting a mediating role of ESM-1 in the pro-angiogenesis effect of HULC.	26894862	2016	HULC long noncoding RNA silencing suppresses angiogenesis by regulating ESM-1 via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in human gliomas	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Mechanistically, we found that the microRNA-186 inhibited HMGA2 expression by targeting the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of HMGA2 mRNA. Strikingly, HULC acted as a competing noncoding RNA to sequester miR-186 and thereby relieved miR-186-mediated HMGA2 repression. Previously, our group reported that HULC could be up-regulated by hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) through transcription factor CREB. HULC interacted with the 5-untranslated region (5-UTR) of CLOCK mRNA via complementary base pairing, resulting in the elevation of CLOCK expression. 	28765279	2017	The long noncoding RNA HULC promotes liver cancer by increasing the expression of the HMGA2 oncogene via sequestration of the microRNA-186.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

The over-expression of HULC and HEIH could promote invasion of MHCC97L and HepG2. Invasion of MHCC97L and HepG2 did not have significant change after down-regulating of HEIH and HULC by siRNA.

Depletion of IGF2BP1 led to an increased HULC half-life and higher steady-state expression levels, indicating a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism. Importantly, HULC represents the first IGF2BP substrate that is destabilized. To elucidate the mechanism by which IGF2BP1 destabilizes HULC, the CNOT1 protein was identified as a novel interaction partner of IGF2BP1.

HULC depletion inhibited the growth and metastasis of HCC cell lines in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, HULC contributes to ZEB1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a requirement for tumor invasion and metastasis that plays a key role in cancer progression.	27285757	2016	LncRNA HULC enhances epithelial-mesenchymal transition to promote tumorigenesis and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma via the miR-200a-3p/ZEB1 signaling pathway.	0	0	1	1	0	0	0

More intriguingly, up-regulation of miR-203 diminished the expression of ADAM9 and HULC in HCC cancer cells. Over-expression of miR-203 could markedly inhibit cell proliferation, invasion and induce cell apoptosis. Furthermore, we identified that miR-203 modulated ADAM9 and HULC in a novel post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism.

Moreover, HULC mRNA levels correlated positively with ACSL1 levels in 60 HCC cases according to real-time PCR analysis. Mechanistic investigations showed that HULC upregulated the transcriptional factor PPARA, which activated the ACSL1 promoter in hepatoma cells. HULC also suppressed miR-9 targeting of PPARA mRNA by eliciting methylation of CpG islands in the miR-9 promoter.

Furthermore, up-regulation of HULC was correlated with grading and overall survival. Meanwhile, HULC could promote cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and inhibit cisplatin-induced apoptosis.

Ectopic expression of HULC elicited the autophagy of HCC cells through stabilizing silent information regulator 1 (Sirt1) protein. In addition, we showed that the level of HULC was positively correlated with that of Sirt1 protein in human HCC tissues.

Luciferase reporter gene assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay showed that HBx activated the HULC promoter via cAMP-responsive element-binding protein. We further demonstrated that HULC promoted cell proliferation by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine, colony formation assay, and tumorigenicity assay.

Functional experiments showed that knockdown of ILF3-AS1 inhibits melanoma cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Mechanistically, we found that ILF3-AS1 interacts with EZH2, promotes the binding of EZH2 to the miR-200b/a/429 promoter, and represses miR-200b/a/429 expression. The expression of ILF3-AS1 is negatively correlated with that of miR-200b/a/429 in melanoma tissues.Moreover,inhibition of miR-200b/a/429 abrogates the biological roles of ILF3-AS1 knockdown on melanoma cell proliferation, migration and invasion. 	28935763	2017	Long noncoding RNA ILF3-AS1 promotes cell proliferation, migration and invasion via negatively regulating miR-200b/a/429 in melanoma	0	0	1	1	0	0	0

Loss of expression of LIT1 also correlated with enrichment of H3 lysine 9 (H3-K9) dimethylation and reduction of H3 lysine 4 (H3-K4) dimethylation. Thus, LIT1 expression appears to be controlled by epigenetic modifications at the KvDMR1, although CDKN1C expression, which is considered to be controlled by LIT1, was not associated with epigenetic status at the KvDMR1 in some colorectal cancer cell lines. Therefore, these findings suggest that LOI of LIT1 via epigenetic disruption plays an important role in colorectal carcinogenesis, but it is not necessarily associated with CDKN1C expression.	16965397	2006	Expression profile of LIT1/KCNQ1OT1 and epigenetic status at the KvDMR1 in colorectal cancers.	0	0	0	0	0	0	1

Moreover, knockdown of KCNQ1OT1 inhibited the cell proliferation, migration, invasion and reduced the expression of drugresistant gene (MRP5, MDR1, LRP1). Cell survival rate of HCC cells was determined with an increasing concentration of OXA. As shown in Fig. 1C, HepG2/OXA and Huh7/OXA cells exhibited a higher cell survival rate, compared with parental HepG2 and Huh7 cells.

Knockdown of CYTOR attenuated colon cancer cell migration and invasion. Conversely, ectopic expression of CYTOR induced an EMT program and enhanced metastatic properties of colon cancer cells. Mechanistically, the binding of CYTOR to cytoplasmic B-catenin impeded casein kinase 1 (CK1)-induced B-catenin phosphorylation that enabled it to accumulate and translocate to the nucleus. Reciprocally, B-catenin/TCF complex enhanced the transcription activity  of CYTOR in nucleus, thus forming a positive feed-forward circuit. Moreover, elevated CYTOR, alone or combined with overexpression of nuclear B-catenin, was predictive of poor prognosis.

Linc00460 expression was positively correlated with ESCC TNM stage, lymph node metastasis and predicted poor prognosis. In vitro experiments showed that linc00460 depletion suppressed ESCC cell growth through regulating cell proliferation and cell cycle; in additional, linc00460 depletion accelerated ESCC cell apoptosis. We further revealed that linc00460 overexpression was manipulated by transcriptional co-activator CBP/P300 through histone acetylation. Given the high expression and important biological functions of linc00460, we suggest that linc00460 work as an oncogene and might be a valuable prognostic biomarker for ESCC diagnosis and treatment.	28939763	2017	A novel long noncoding RNA linc00460 upregulated by CBP/P300 promotes carcinogenesis in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma	MTX	0	0	0	0	0	0

Our studies found that LINC00461 positively affects both MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways.  CyclinD1 binds to CDK4 and CDK6 (cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6) to phosphorylate retinoblastoma protein and activate the transcription factor E2F-1. In this study, we have found that LINC00461 regulates miRNA miR-9, which is the mature form of miR-9-2 gene.

Linc-ITGB1 depletion caused cell accumulation in the G0/G1 phase. Furthermore, the linc-ITGB1 knockdown decreased the expression of mesenchymal markers N-cadherin and vimentin while increasing the expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin. Key cell cycle regulators Cdc25C and Cyclin B1 were also decreased by the linc-ITGB1 knockdown. These data suggest that linc-ITGB1 promotes breast cancer progression by inducing cell-cycle arrest and interrupting the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process.	26601916	2015	Long non-coding RNA linc-ITGB1 promotes cell migration and invasion in human breast cancer.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We find that LINC-PINT is downregulated in multiple types of cancer and acts as a tumor suppressor lncRNA by reducing the invasive phenotype of cancer cells. A cross-species analysis identifies a highly conserved sequence element in LINCPINT that is essential for its function. This sequence mediates a specific interaction with PRC2, necessary for the LINC-PINT-dependent repression of a pro-invasion signature of genes regulated by the transcription factor EGR1.	29078818	2017	The human lncRNA LINC-PINT inhibits tumor cell invasion through a highly conserved sequence element	0	1	1	0	0	1	0

In particular, we hypothesized that lncRNA-ROR may act as a ceRNA, effectively becoming a sink for miR-145, thereby activating the derepression of core transcription factors Oct4. Thus, curcumin suppresses the proliferation, in vitro invasion, and tumorigenicity of HuPCaSCs through ceRNA effect of miR-145 and lncRNA-ROR caused.	28843521	2017	Curcumin suppresses proliferation and in vitro invasion of human prostate cancer stem cells by ceRNA effect of miR-145 and lncRNA-ROR	0	0	1	1	0	1	0

Importantly, a 28-base RoR sequence carrying hnRNP I binding motifs is essential and sufficient for p53 repression. We further show that RoR inhibits p53-mediated cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.

Under estrogen deprivation, linc-RoR causes the upregulation of phosphorylated MAPK/ERK pathway which in turn activates ER signaling. Knockout of linc-RoR abrogates estrogen deprivation-induced ERK activation as well as ER phosphorylation, whereas re-expression of linc-RoR restores all above phenotypes. Moreover, we show that the ERK-specific phosphatase Dual Specificity Phosphatase 7 (DUSP7), also known as MKP-X, is involved in linc-RoR KOinduced repression of MAPK/ERK signaling. Interestingly, linc-RoR KO increases the protein stability of DUSP7, resulting in repression of ERK phosphorylation. Clinical data analysis reveal that DUSP7 expression is lower in ER+ breast cancer samples than that in ER- breast cancer. Moreover, downregulation of DUSP7 expression is associated with poor patient survival.	29041978	2017	Linc-RoR promotes MAPK/ERK signaling and confers estrogen-independent growth of breast cancer	tamoxifen	0	1	0	0	0	0

Lnc-Tim3 plays a pivotal role in stimulating CD8 T exhaustion and the survival of the exhausted CD8 T cells. Mechanistically, Lnc-Tim3 specifically binds to Tim-3 and blocks its interaction with Bat3, thus suppressing downstream Lck/ NFAT1/AP-1 signaling, leading to nuclear localization of Bat3, and enhancing p300-dependent p53 and RelA transcriptional activation of  anti-apoptosis genes including MDM2 and Bcl-2.	29706626	2018	Long non-coding RNA Lnc-Tim3 exacerbates CD8 T cell exhaustion via binding to Tim-3 and inducing nuclear translocation of Bat3 in HCC.	0	1	1	0	0	0	0

LncZic2 drove the expression of myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate (MARCKS) and  MARCKS-like 1 (MARCKSL1), whose expression levels were increased during liver tumorigenesis and liver TIC self-renewal. Mechanistically, lncZic2 interacted with BRM/SWI2-related gene 1 (BRG1) and recruited this transcriptional regulator  to the promoters of the MARCKS and MARCKSL1 gene, which activated expression of these genes. Moreover, we noted that depletion of lncZic2 and BRG1 decreases MARCKS and MARCKSL1 expression and diminishes liver TIC levels. In conclusion, LncZic2 is required for the self-renewal of liver TICs by up-regulating MARCKS and MARCKSL1 gene expression via the transcription factor BRG1. 	29588366	2018	The long noncoding RNA lncZic2 drives the self-renewal of liver tumor-initiating  cells via the protein kinase C substrates MARCKS and MARCKSL1.  	1	0	1	0	0	1	0

Subsequently, using cervical cancer cell lines, HeLa and ME-180, we decreased the expression levels of Loc554202 with siRNA. As results, the proliferation ability of cervical cancer cells was inhibited and apoptosis was induced after Loc554202 knockdown, as judged by viability assay, colony formation, and flow cytometry. Moreover, knockdown of Loc554202 expression downregulated Bcl-2 expression and conversely up-regulated Bax expression in cervical cancer cells using Western blotting analysis.

In addition, silencing of MALAT1 by intratumoral injection of MALAT1 shRNA attenuated the tumor growth in mice bearing myeloma xenograft and led to massive apoptosis in the xenograft tumor.

We found that MALAT-1 expression in patients with acute monocytic leukemia (M5) was significantly increased when compared with that of healthy controls, and the overall survival of M5 patients with high MALAT-1 expression was markedly reduced when compared with the overall survival of patients with low MALAT-1 expression. MALAT-1 knockdown was found to induce upregulated protein expression of cyclin E and cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) by silencing tumor suppressor gene p53 and activating transcription factor E2F, as a consequence of G1/S phase transition to G2 phase (29). 	28713913	2017	Upregulation of long non-coding RNA MALAT-1 confers poor prognosis and influences cell proliferation and apoptosis in acute monocytic leukemia.	0	0	1	0	0	1	0

In addition, silencing of MALAT1 clearly improved the sensitivity of GBM cells to chemotherapeutic agents including the current first-line therapy of GBM [temozolomide (TMZ)]. In animal models of GBM, tumor involution with a modest but statistically significant survival benefit was achieved with concurrent treatment of TMZ and nanocomplex-mediated silencing of MALAT1.Expressions of both OCT4 and NANOG, transcription factors known to maintain pluripotency and self-renewal of embryonic stem cells, were significantly reduced (34.2% and 20.2%, respectively) after scL-siMAL treatment.	29202181	2018	Targeted nanocomplex carrying siRNA against MALAT1 sensitizes glioblastoma to temozolomide.	temozolomide	1	1	0	0	1	0

Importantly, the results of flow cytometry assay and transwell assay reveal that the MALAT1-mediated cancer progression is in part due to specific suppression of miR-125b and activation of its two target genes. All together, these data suggest that the “MALAT1-miR-125b-Bcl-2 / MMP-13” axis plays an important role in the progression of BCa, thereby may provide a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of human BCa.	29151968	2017	LncRNA MALAT1 Inhibits Apoptosis and Promotes Invasion by Antagonizing miR-125b in Bladder Cancer Cells	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

Plasma levels of MALAT1-derived fragments are significantly elevated in patients with prostate cancer compared with those without prostate cance. MALAT1 regulates KRAS expression by influencing the spatial distribution of miR-217. MALAT1 inhibits the translocation of miR-217 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Patients with PDAC and high MALAT1 expression levels have shorter overall survival than patients with PDAC and low MALAT1 expression levels. Resistance to KRAS inhibition has been observed experimentally in studies regarding pancreatic cancer treatment34; thus, targeting MALAT1 may be another way to achieve KRAS/MAPK pathway inactivation.	28701723	2017	The lncRNA MALAT1 acts as a competing endogenous RNA to regulate KRAS expression by sponging miR-217 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.	1	1	1	1	0	0	0

SFPQ critically mediated the regulatory effects of MALAT1. Moreover, in CRC tissues, MALAT1 and PTBP2 were overexpressed, both of which were associated closely with the invasion and metastasis of CRC.

Therefore, we hypothesized that EZH2 might be recruited by MALAT-1 to synergistically repress E-cadherin. To test this hypothesis, we first asked whether MALAT-1 bound to EZH2 using a RNA Immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay.

In addition, MALAT1 expression was significantly correlated with tumor size, WHO grade and Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), and was an independent prognostic factor for survival of glioma patients. Further, MALAT1 suppresses cell viability by down-regulating miR-155. FBXW7 mRNA was identified as a direct target of miR-155 in glioma.

Functionally, knockdown of MALAT1 resulted in an impairment and increased the permeability of BTB as well as decreased the expression of ZO-1, occludin and claudin-5 in GECs. Further, there was reciprocal repression between MALAT1 and miR-140, and miR-140 mediated the effects that MALAT1 knockdown exerted.

In addition, MALAT1 and miR-145 expression inversely changed in response to irradiation in HR-HPV+ cervical cancer cells. We found CaSki and Hela cells with knockdown of MALAT1 had significantly lower colony formation, higher ratio of G2/M phase block and higher ratio of cell apoptosis. Next, we confirmed that miR-145 and MALAT1 were in the same Ago2 complex and there was a reciprocal repression between them. Then, we explored the function of MALAT1-miR-145 in radiosensitivity of cervical cancers cells and demonstrated that si-MALAT1 and miR-145 had some level of synergic effect in reducing cancer cell colony formation, cell cycle regulation, and inducing apoptosis.	26311052	2015	Long non-coding RNA MALAT1 modulates radiosensitivity of HR-HPV+ cervical cancer via sponging miR-145.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

Knockdown of endogenous MALAT1 significantly reduced cell growth rate and invasion and increased cell apoptosis of Hela and siHa cells. Besides, knockdown of MALAT1 increased the expression of miRNA-124, while ectopic expression of miR-124 decreased MALAT1 expression. MALAT1 can indirectly modulate GRB2 expression via competing miR-124. Knockdown of GRB2 reduced cell invasion and increased cell apoptosis. In conclusion, MALAT1 can promote HR-HPV (+) cancer cell growth and invasion at least partially through the MALAT1-miR-124-RBG2 axis.	26242259	2015	MALAT1-miR-124-RBG2 axis is involved in growth and invasion of HR-HPV-positive cervical cancer cells.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

MALAT1 plays important roles in MM DNA repair and cell death. We found bone marrow plasma cells from patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and MM express elevated MALAT1 and involve in alternative non-homozygous end joining (A-NHEJ) pathway by binding to PARP1 and LIG3, two key components of the A-NHEJ protein complex. Degradation of the MALAT1 RNA by RNase H using antisense gapmer DNA oligos in MM cells stimulated poly-ADP-ribosylation of nuclear proteins, defected the DNA repair pathway, and further provoked apoptotic pathways. Anti-MALAT1 therapy combined with PARP1 inhibitor or proteasome inhibitor in MM cells showed a synergistic effect in vitro. 	29632340	2018	Targeting the MALAT1/PARP1/LIG3 complex induces DNA damage and apoptosis in multiple myeloma. 	1	0	1	0	0	0	0

We found that metformin could suppress cervical cancer migration and invasion. During the process of tumor metastasis, miR-142-3p was significantly upregulated, whereas lncRNA MATAL1 and HMGA2 were suppressed by metformin.

Conversely, overexpression of MALAT1 caused significant reduction in cell proliferation and invasion in vitro, and tumorigenicity in both subcutaneous and intracranial human glioma xenograft models. Furthermore, MALAT1-mediated tumor suppression in glioma cells may be via reduction of extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK/MAPK) signaling activity and expression of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2). 	26938295	2016	Tumor-suppressive function of long noncoding RNA MALAT1 in glioma cells by downregulation of MMP2 and inactivation of ERK/MAPK signaling.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

In conclusion, our findings suggest that the failure of a repressive complex to form or stabilize in breast cancer promotes CD133 upregulation and an EMT-like program, providing new mechanistic insights underlying the control of prometastatic processes.	27197265	2016	The Ribonucleic Complex HuR-MALAT1 Represses CD133 Expression and Suppresses Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in Breast Cancer.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

During the malignant transformation of human hepatic epithelial (L-02) cells induced by a low concentration (2.0 μM) of arsenite, MALAT1 and HIF-2a are increased. In addition, arsenite-induced MALAT1 causes disassociation of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein from HIF-2a, therefore, alleviating VHL-mediated HIF-2a ubiquitination, which causes HIF-2a accumulation.

These findings suggest that the MALAT1/miR-211/PHF19 axis may act as a key mediator in OC and provide new insight into the prevention of this disease. MALAT1 expression was up-regulated in OC tissues compared with normal ovarian tissues. A significant positive correlation was noted between MALAT1 and PHF19 . Meanwhile, TCGA cohort analysis showed that higher expression of MALAT1 was correlated with shorter survival times for patients with OC. To confirm the role of MALAT1 in OC, we further knocked down the expression of MALAT1 in SKOV3 cells . The results show that silence of MALAT1 significantly inhibited cell proliferation  and colony formation ability in SKOV3 cells. Moreover, an increasing number of apoptotic cells were observed in MALAT1- silenced SKOV3 cells . In addition, silence of MALAT1 also dramatically suppressed the migration of SKOV3 cells. In vivo, the xenograft experiment showed that infection with MALAT1 shRNA lentivirus in SKOV3 cells significantly reduced the tumor growth rate. These data suggest that MALAT1 may be an oncogenic lncRNA in OC. 	29874124	2018	miR-211 sponges lncRNA MALAT1 to suppress tumor growth and progression through inhibiting PHF19 in ovarian carcinoma.	0	0	1	1	0	0	0

Compared with 16HBE cells, MALAT-1 was highly expressed in NSCLC tissues. Compared with the blank group, E-cadherin and cell apoptosis were increased, but vimentin, cell variability, cell invasion, and migration ability in the si-MALAT-1 and miR-124 mimics groups were reduced. Compared with the blank group, decreased E-cadherin and cell apoptosis and increased vimentin, cell variability, cell invasion, and migration ability were detected in the oe-MALAT-1 group. The oe-MALAT-1+miR-124 mimics group had increased E-cadherin and cell apoptosis, but decreased vimentin, cell variability, cell invasion, and migration ability in comparison with the oe-MALAT-1 group. By competitively regulating miR-124, MALAT-1 can promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition, thus accelerating the development of NSCLC.  	29782349	2018	LncRNA MALAT-1 competitively regulates miR-124 to promote EMT and development of non-small-cell lung cancer.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

Among the five, MEG3 showed significant down-expression. Overexpression of MEG3 inhibits thyroid cancer cell migration and invasion.Thus, this study suggests that MEG3 acts as novel suppressor of migration and invasion by targeting Rac1 gene.	25997963	2015	Long non-coding RNA MEG3 suppresses migration and invasion of thyroid carcinoma by targeting of Rac1.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We found that, while ERMS tumors consistently show LOI of the DMR at the DLK1-GTL2 locus, ARMS tumors have erasure of imprinting (EOI) at this locus. These changes in imprinting status of the DLK1-GTL2 locus result in a higher GTL2/DLK1 mRNA ratio in ARMS as compared to ERMS. 	24173021	2014	The paternally imprinted DLK1-GTL2 locus is differentially methylated in embryonal and alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas.	0	0	0	0	0	0	1

Strikingly, MEG3 inhibits B-catenin activity through PKM2 reduction and PTEN increase.Significantly,we also found that excessive B-catenin abrogated the effect of MEG3 in liver cancer.MEG3 overexpression increased the PTEN 3-UTR mRNA methylation compared to control.

The overexpression of MEG3 and underexpression of ANRIL were significantly associated with GBC prognosis. The expressions of MEG3 and ANRIL were higher in pcDNA-MEG3 and pcDNA-ANRIL-transfected cells than in empty vector-transfected cells in vitro. Most of the pcDNA-MEG3-transfected cells were in the G0-G1 phase, which showed reduced cell activity and clone counts and increased p53 and decreased cyclin D1, whereas the pcDNA-ANRIL-transfected cells were mostly in the S phase and showed contrasting behavior.

We further found that MEG3 stimulates expression of the growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) by enhancing p53 binding to the GDF15 gene promoter. Interestingly, MEG3 does not stimulate p21(CIP1) expression, suggesting that MEG3 can regulate the specificity of p53 transcriptional activation. p53 degradation is mainly mediated by the mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2). We found that MDM2 levels were down-regulated in cells transfected with MEG3, suggesting that MDM2 suppression contributes at least in part to p53 accumulation induced by MEG3.

Although the absence of expression of MEG3 was not statistically correlated to either histological grade or TNM stage in the 25 cases, the prognosis was significantly worse. MEG3 knockdown enhanced cell proliferation, promoted cell migration and invasion, induced epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), increased the sphere-forming ability and cancer stem cell (CSC) properties, and decreased the chemosensitivity to gemcitabine in-vitro.

Furthermore, Meg3 relied on functional EZH2, a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) to inhibit c-Met expression. Another mechanism of lncRNA-mediated regulation of gene expression utilized triplex forming GA-GT rich sequences. Transfection of such motifs from Meg3 RNA, termed triplex forming oligos (TFOs), in MIN6 cells, suppressed c-Met expression and enhanced cell proliferation, perhaps by modulating other targets. This study comprehensively establishes epigenetic mechanisms underlying Meg3 control of c-Met and the oncogenic consequences of Meg3 loss or c-Met gain.

Interestingly, MEG3 does not stimulate p21(CIP1) expression, suggesting that MEG3 can regulate the specificity of p53 transcriptional activation. p53 degradation is mainly mediated by the mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2).

Knockdown of MEG3 inhibited TGF-B-mediated changes in cell morphology and cell motility characteristic of EMT and counteracted TGF-B-dependent changes in the expression of EMT-related genes such as CDH1, ZEB family, and the microRNA-200 family. Overexpression of MEG3 influenced the expression of these genes and enhanced the effects of TGF-B in their expressions. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) revealed that MEG3 regulated the recruitment of JARID2 and EZH2 and histone H3 methylation on the regulatory regions of CDH1 and microRNA-200 family genes for transcriptional repression.	27852821	2017	MEG3 Long Noncoding RNA Contributes to the Epigenetic Regulation of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in Lung Cancer Cell Lines.	0	0	0	1	0	1	1

On the other hand, knockdown of MEG3 promoted the growth of well-differentiated cervical carcinoma HCC94 cells. Further investigation into the mechanisms responsible for the growth inhibitory effects revealed that overexpression of MEG3 resulted in the induction of G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.	23790166	2013	Long non-coding RNA MEG3 inhibits the proliferation of cervical carcinoma cells through the induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Furthermore, miR-93 was predicted a direct target of lncRNA-MEG3 by bioinformatics analysis. Overexpressed MEG3 counteracted the role of miR-93 in facilitating proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis in U-251 cells.

The inhibition affection in proliferation and inducing affection in apoptosis was further confirmed in vivo and vitro, we also demonstrated that MEG3 regulates HCC cell proliferation and apoptosis partially via the accumulation of p53. Besides, the hypermethylation of MEG3 in promoter region was identified by bisulfite sequencing while MEG3 increased with the inhibition of methylation. Down-regulation of UHRF1 induced MEG3 expression in HCC cell lines, which could be reversed by the up-regulation of UHRF1.

Deregulation of DLK1 and MEG3 expression accompanied by extensive aberrations in DNA methylation could be confirmed experimentally in an independent series of human HCC (n = 40) in more than 80% of cases. Loss of methylation at the DLK1-MEG3 locus correlates linearly with global loss of DNA methylation in HCC. Inhibition of DNMT1 in HCC cells using siRNA led to a reduction in MEG3-DMR methylation and concomitant increase in MEG3 RNA expression.

Unlike P53 positive tumors, MIAT expression was upregulated in ER, PR, Her2 positive tumor tissues. An increase in the expression of mir-302, mir-150, and a decrease in the expression of mir-29c were detected following MIAT silencing. More importantly, knockdown MIAT significantly elevated the expression of p16Ink4A and Cox2, which commitment cellular senescence in breast cancer cells.	29345338	2018	MIAT lncRNA is overexpressed in breast cancer and its inhibition triggers senescence and G1 arrest in MCF7 cell line.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Moreover, MIAT knockdown decreased cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and cell cycle arrested in G1 phase. Mechanistic investigation revealed that MIAT could interact with histone methyltransferase mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL). MIAT silencing impeded the binding of MLL on the matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) promoter region and epigenetically reduced MMP9 transcriptional activity. Overall, our fndings suggest that MIAT expression is associated with NSCLC and may be one of the critical targets in progression and metastasis in NSCLC.	29228680	2017	Long noncoding RNA MIAT promotes non-small cell lung cancer proliferation and metastasis through MMP9 activation	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Mechanistically, MINCR/miR-26a-5p/EZH2 axis was found to be involved in cell proliferation, cell invasive and apoptosis in GBC cells.

To understand its cellular role, we performed RNAi and found that MINCR knockdown is associated with an impairment in cell cycle progression. Differential gene expression analysis after RNAi showed a significant enrichment of cell cycle genes among the genes down-regulated after MINCR knockdown. Interestingly, these genes are enriched in MYC binding sites in their promoters, suggesting that MINCR acts as a modulator of the MYC transcriptional program. Accordingly, MINCR knockdown was associated with a reduction in MYC binding to the promoters of selected cell cycle genes.	26351698	2015	MINCR is a MYC-induced lncRNA able to modulate MYC's transcriptional network in Burkitt lymphoma cells.	0	0	0	0	0	1	1

Our results describe a double-negative feedback loop between MIR100HG and the transcription factor GATA6, whereby GATA6 represses MIR100HG, but this repression is relieved by miR-125b targeting of GATA6.

By associating with the RNA-binding protein TIAR, MT1JP enhanced the translation of the master transcription factor p53, thereby regulating a series of pathways involving p53, such as the cell cycle, apoptosis and proliferation. When MT1JP was down-regulated, the protein level of p53 declined, which in turn accelerated cell deterioration and tumor formation. Moreover, differential expression of MT1JP in cancerous and normal tissues suggests that it may be a promising prognostic marker and a therapeutic target.	26909858	2016	LncRNA MT1JP functions as a tumor suppressor by interacting with TIAR to modulate the p53 pathway.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

Functional analysis showed that lncRNA MT1JP regulated FBXW7 expression by competitively binding to miR-92a-3p. MiR-92a-3p and down-regulated FBXW7 reversed cell phenotypes caused by lncRNA MT1JP by rescue analysis.MT1JP, a down-regulated lncRNA in GC,was associated with malignant tumor phenotypes and survival of GC.MT1JP regulated the progression of GC by functioning as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to competitively bind to miR-92a-3p and regulate FBXW7 expression. Our study provided new insight into the post-transcriptional regulation mechanism of lncRNA MT1JP,and suggested that MT1JP may act as a potential therapeutic target and prognosis biomarker for GC.	29720189	2018	LncRNA MT1JP functions as a ceRNA in regulating FBXW7 through competitively binding to miR-92a-3p in gastric cancer.	0	0	1	1	0	0	0

Low expression of MT1JP was significantly correlated with advanced TNM stage and lymphatic metastasis. Gain- and loss-of-function of MT1JP revealed that MT1JP functioned as a ceRNA for miR-214-3p to facilitate RUNX3 expression and then upregulated p21 and Bim levels suppressing GC cell proliferation, invasion and migration, and promoting apoptosis. Furthermore, MT1JP overexpression suppressed tumor growth and inhibited the expression of miR-214-3p and proliferation antigen Ki-67, but increased the expression of RUNX3, p21 and Bim in vivo. Our results suggest a potential ceRNA regulatory network involving MT1JP regulates RUNX3 expression by competitively binding endogenous miR-214-3p in tumorigenesis and progression of GC. 	29742512	2018	LncRNA MT1JP Suppresses Gastric Cancer Cell Proliferation and Migration Through MT1JP/MiR-214-3p/RUNX3 Axis.	0	0	1	1	0	0	0

Conversely, MYCN reduction increased MYCNOS-01 transcript levels,creating a negative feedback loop on MYCN protein levels.Reduction of MYCNOS-01 or MYCN expression decreased cell growth in MYCN-amplified alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma and neuroblastoma cell lines.This is consistent with MYCNOS-01-mediated regulation of MYCN contributing to the phenotype observed.Another possibility therefore is that MYCNOS-01 interacts with an miRNA that targets MYCN for degradation, therefore increasing MYCN protein expression by sequestering away a negative regulating factor.	29466962	2018	The long non-coding RNA MYCNOS-01 regulates MYCN protein levels and affects growth of MYCN-amplified rhabdomyosarcoma and neuroblastoma cells.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

The gain- and loss-of-function analysis revealed that LncMyd88 could promote the proliferation and metastasis of HCC both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, ChIP assays demonstrated that Lnc-Myd88 might increase Myd88 expression through enhancing H3K27Ac in the promoter of Myd88 gene, thus resulting in the activation of both NF-kB and PI3K/AKT signal pathways. In conclusion, we proposed that Lnc-Myd88 might serve as a novel diagnosis and therapeutic target for HCC.	29022910	2017	Long non-coding RNA Myd88 promotes growth and metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma via regulating Myd88 expression through H3K27 modification	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

Particularly, reduced NBAT1 in breast cancer is associated with tumor metastasis and poor patient prognosis. In vitro, ectopic NBAT1 inhibits migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. Mechanistic study shows that NBAT1 is associated with PRC2 member EZH2 and regulates global gene expression profile. Among them, DKK1 (dickkopf WNT signaling pathway inhibitor 1) is found to be regulated by NBAT1 in a PRC2 dependent manner, and is responsible for NBAT1's effects in inhibiting migration and invasion of breast cancer cells.	26378045	2015	NBAT1 suppresses breast cancer metastasis by regulating DKK1 via PRC2.	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

However, the expression pattern,the biological function and the mechanisms of NBAT1 in OS progress have not been elucidated. In this study, for the frst time, we found that NBAT1 expression is downregulated in OS tissues and cell lines and is associated with clinical stage, distant metastasis and poor prognosis. Loss- and gain-of-function assays showed that NBAT1 played a negative regulatory role in OS growth and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Further investigation demonstrated that NBAT1 physically interacted with miR-21 and then suppressed its expression. NBAT1 also regulated downstream genes targeted by miR-21, including PTEN, PDCD4, TPM1 and RECK. 	29119050	2017	Long noncoding RNA NBAT1 negatively modulates growth and metastasis of osteosarcoma cells through suppression of miR-21	0	0	1	1	0	0	0

CCK-8 assay and colony-formation assays showed that silencing of NEAT1 by siRNA pool inhibited NSCLC cell proliferation. An increased population of apoptotic cells was detected upon NEAT1 depletion by acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining compared to control cells. A549 cells depleted of NEAT1 exhibited reduced invasion and migration, characterized by wound healing assay and Transwell assay. To uncover the molecular mechanism of NEAT1 in lung cancer, we identified that NEAT1 could be a  competing endogenous RNA against let-7a, and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-2 could be a direct target of let-7a. These were characterized by reciprocal expression between NEAT1/IGF-2 and let-7a. Luciferase reporter assay validated direct binding of NEAT1/let-7a and let-7a/IGF-2.

We also found that posttranscriptional silencing of PCAT-1 by miR-215 or PCAT-1 siRNAs significantly inhibited proliferation of HCC cells and, conversely, that inhibition of endogenous miR-215 upregulated PCAT-1 expression and promoted cell viability. The tumor-suppressing role of miR-215 was further confirmed in an in vivo mouse HCC xenograft model. Of note, gene profiling assays suggested that the kinase CRKlike proto-oncogene, adaptor protein (CRKL) is a potential downstream target of the miR-215- PCAT-1 axis in HCC, and we demonstrated that CRKL silencing significantly suppresses cell proliferation. 	28887306	2017	The long noncoding RNA PCAT-1 links the microRNA miR-215 to oncogene CRKL-mediated signaling in hepatocellular carcinoma	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

Using GEO database analysis and the measurement of clinical samples, it was revealed that CRC patients with high PVT1 expression demonstrated poor OS. Multivariate analysis indicated that high PVT1 expression is an independent risk  factor for patients with CRC. In addition, PVT1 knockdown suppressed the proliferation, invasion and metastasis of CRC cells in vitro, which were associated with decreasing vimentin, cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 expression and enhanced E-cadherin expression. The results of the present study suggest that PVT1 may serve a critical role in CRC progression and metastasis and may serve as a potential prognostic biomarker for CRC.	29512788	2018	Upregulated plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 promotes cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis in colorectal cancer.	0	0	1	0	1	0	0

Furthermore, PVT1 knockdown enhances IFN-a-induced  HCC cell apoptosis by promoting phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and upregulating IFN-stimulated genes expression. Moreover, PVT1 specifically interacts with STAT1 in HCC cells. Taken  together, these results for the first time indicate that IFN-a treatment promotes oncogenic PVT1 expression in HCC cells, which interacts with STAT1 to inhibit IFN-a signaling, ultimately blocking IFN-a-induced cells apoptosis, suggesting that lncRNA PVT1 may be a potential target to improve IFN-a-mediated HCC immunotherapies.	29715456	2018	Long noncoding RNA PVT1 inhibits interferon-a mediated therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma cells by interacting with signal transducer and activator of transcription 1.	0	0	0	0	0	0	1

PVT1 is upregulated in clinical TNBC tumors. Using genetic approaches targeting PVT1 in TNBC cells, we found that PVT1 depletion inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, and orthotopic xenograft tumor growth. Mechanistically, PVT1 binds with KLF5 and increases its stability via BAP1, which upregulates beta-catenin signaling, resulting in enhanced TNBC tumorigenesis. PVT1, KLF5, and beta-catenin were also revealed to be co-expressed in clinical TNBC samples. Our findings uncover a new singaling pathway to mediate TNBC, and provide PVT1 as a new target for improving treatment of TNBC. 	29760406	2018	LncRNA PVT1 regulates triple-negative breast cancer through KLF5/beta-catenin signaling.	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

CRISPR interference of PVT1 promoter enhances breast cancer cell competition and  growth in vivo. The promoters of the PVT1 and the MYC oncogenes, located 55 kb apart on chromosome 8q24, compete for engagement with four intragenic enhancers in the PVT1 locus, thereby allowing the PVT1 promoter to regulate pause release of MYC transcription. PVT1 undergoes developmentally regulated monoallelic expression, and the PVT1 promoter inhibits MYC expression only from the same chromosome via promoter competition. Cancer genome sequencing identifies recurrent mutations encompassing the human PVT1 promoter, and genome editing verified that PVT1 promoter mutation promotes cancer cell growth.	29731168	2018	Promoter of lncRNA Gene PVT1 Is a Tumor-Suppressor DNA Boundary Element.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0

To further reveal the function of SOX2/ PVT1 in breast cancer, the MTT and invasion assay were performed through silencing of PVT1 or SOX2.

Furthermore, SDPR-AS and SDPR expressions were positively correlated. Overexpression and knockdown experiments suggested that SDPR-AS and SDPR were coregulated in RCC cell lines. In addition, overexpression of SDPR-AS suppressed cell migration and invasion, but not cell growth. Furthermore, expression of SDPR-AS was associated with tumor differentiation and lymphatic metastasis. Kaplan-Meier survival and log-rank tests demonstrated the association of elevated expression of SDPR-AS with increased overall survival.

Elevated SFTA1P induced apoptosis and enhanced the sensitivity to cisplatin of LSCC cells. We further identified that hnRNP-U (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U) was down-regulated in LSCCs and positively correlated with patients’ poor prognosis as well as SFTA1P. Mechanistic studies revealed that SFTA1P could up-regulate hnRNP-U expression.

In addition, decreased SFTA1P expression was strongly correlated with advanced tumor lymph node metastasis (TNM) stage, larger tumor size, lymphatic metastasis, and poor prognosis of patients with GC. Moreover, gain-of-function experiments revealed that the overexpression of SFTA1P inhibits cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, thus verifying the tumor inhibitory role of SFTA1P in GC.

Mechanistic studies  indicated that SH3PXD2A-AS1 could epiqenetically repress P57 and KLF2 expression  through interaction with EZH2. Rescue experiments suggested that SH3PXD2A-ASl-mediated oncogenesis was impaired by overexpression of P57 or KLF2.

We show that the KAI1 promoter is bi-directional giving rise to KAI1 mRNA and its as-lncRNA. Moreover, expression of this lncRNA transcript emerges to be inversely related to the KAI1 mRNA expression, and in direct relationship to the invasiveness level of human breast cancer derived cell lines. Importantly, knockdown of the KAI1 as-lncRNA in the triple-negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 have led to increased KAI1 mRNA and protein expression, manifested in stronger adhesion to fibronectin, retardation of cell migration and reduced cell invasion in vitro. Accordingly we have named this lncRNA, SKAI1BC, standing for Suppressor of KAI1 in Breast Cancer.	28978052	2017	Identification of a novel metastasis inducing lncRNA which suppresses the KAI1/CD82 metastasis suppressor gene and is upregulated in triple-negative breast cancer.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Furthermore, increased SNHG15 expression was positively correlated with invasion depth, advanced tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage, and lymph node metastasis. SNHG15 levels were robust in differentiating GC tissues from controls. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that elevated SNHG15 expression contributed to poor overall survival and disease-free survival of patients. A multivariate survival analysis also indicated that SNHG15 could be an independent prognostic marker.

In vitro, loss-of-functional cellular experiments showed that SNHG15 silencing significantly inhibited the proliferation, promoted the apoptosis, and induced the cycle arrest at G0//G1 phase. In vivo, xenograft assay showed that SNHG15 silencing suppressed tumor growth of NSCLC cells. Besides, SNHG15 silencing decreased CDK14 protein expression both in vivo and vitro.

SOX3 and TDGF-1 were up-regulated in human glioma tissues and GSCs. Knockdown of SOX3 inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of GSCs, promoted GSCs apoptosis, and decreased TDGF-1 mRNA and protein expression through direct binding to the TDGF-1 promoter. Over-expression of miR-194-5p and miR-122 decreased the mRNA and protein expression of SOX3 by targeting its 3’UTR. Furthermore, SOX3 knockdown also inhibited the SOX2OT expression through direct binding to the SOX2OT promoter and formed a positive feedback loop.	29132362	2017	Knockdown of SOX2OT inhibits the malignant biological behaviors of glioblastoma stem cells via up-regulating the expression of miR-194-5p and miR-122	0	0	1	1	0	0	0

Besides that, miR-194-5p was predicted to be a target of SOX2OT and decreased expression of miR-194-5p was observed in GC tissues and cell lines. Overexpressed miR-194-5p counteracted the promoting role  of SOX2OT on cell proliferation and invasion of GC cells. Moreover, AKT2 was predicted to be a target of miR-194-5p. The expression of AKT2 was negatively regulated by miR-194-5p while positively regulated by SOX2OT. Overexpressed AKT2  also promoted GC cell proliferation and invasion. Our in vitro experiments suggested that SOX2OT promoted cell proliferation and metastasis of GC cells via  sponging miR-194-5p from AKT2.

Knockdown of TATDN1-1 by shRNA significantly inhibited cell proliferation, adhesion, migration and invasion in 95D cells. Further mechanism study showed that TATDN1 knockdown suppressed the expression of E-cadherin, HER2, B-catenin and Ezrin. Moreover, knockdown TATDN1 also inhibited tumor growth and metastasis in a 95D mouse model in vivo by inhibiting B-catenin and Ezrin.

Knockdown of TUG1 inhibited the proliferation, motility, and invasiveness of cultured ICC cells, and decreased tumor burden in a xenograft mouse model. When we explored the mechanisms underlying these effects, we found that TUG1 acts as an endogenous competing RNA (ceRNA) that ‘sponges’ miR-145, thereby preventing the degradation of Sirt3 mRNA and increasing expression of Sirt3 and GDH proteins. Accordingly, glutamine consumption, a-KG production, and ATP levels were dramatically decreased by TUG1 knockdown in ICC cells, and this effect was reversed by miR-145 inhibition. These findings indicate that the TUG1/miR-145/Sirt3/GDH regulatory network may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for treatment of ICC.	29371936	2017	LncRNA TUG1 sponges miR-145 to promote cancer progression and regulate glutamine metabolism via Sirt3/GDH axis	0	0	1	1	0	0	0

Both the upregulated TUG1, and FMNL2 and the downregulated miR-219 was associated with advanced stage of OSCC and poor overall survival.Increasing evidences indicated that the dysregulated lncRNAs and miRNAs were correlated with tumor progression and cancer-related cellular process, including proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion. 	28979812	2017	Long non-coding RNA TUG1 promotes progression of oral squamous cell carcinoma through upregulating FMNL2 by sponging miR-219	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

Interestingly, inhibition of TUG1 could upregulate homeobox B7 (HOXB7) expression; ChIP assays demonstrated that the promoter of HOXB7 locus was bound by EZH2 (enhancer of zeste homolog 2), a key component of PRC2, and was H3K27 trimethylated. This TUG1-mediated growth regulation is in part due to specific modulation of HOXB7, thus participating in AKT and MAPK pathways. Together, these results suggest that p53-regulated TUG1 is a growth regulator, which acts in part through control of HOXB7.

To further our understanding of the mechanisms of UCA1, a system of experiments was built. We found that miR-507 could directly bind to UCA1 at the miRNA recognition site, and that there was a negative correlation between miR-507 and UCA1. Additionally, FOXM1 is a target of miR-507 and can be downregulated by either miR-507 overexpression or UCA1 depletion.

Mechanistically, P53 (N340Q/L344R) forms complex with CUDR and the complex binds to the promoter regions of PKM2 which enhances the expression, phosphorylation of PKM2 and its polymer formation. Thereby, the polymer PKM2 (tetramer) binds to the eleventh threonine on histone H3 that increases the phosphorylation of the eleventh threonine on histone H3 (pH3T11). Furthermore, pH3T11 blocks HDAC3 binding to H3K9Ac that prevents H3K9Ac from deacetylation and stabilizes the H3K9Ac modification. On the other hand, it also decreased tri-methylation of histone H3 on the ninth lysine (H3K9me3) and increases one methylation of histone H3 on the ninth lysine (H3K9me1). Moreover, the combination of H3K9me1 and HP1 a forms more H3K9me3-HP1a complex which binds to the promoter region of Pim1, enhancing the expression of Pim1 that enhances the expression of TERT, oncogenic lncRNA HOTAIR and reduces the TERRA expression.	27167190	2016	Double mutant P53 (N340Q/L344R) promotes hepatocarcinogenesis through upregulation of Pim1 mediated by PKM2 and LncRNA CUDR	0	0	0	0	0	0	1

Moreover, UCA1 depletion inhibited the growth and induced apoptosis in PC3 and LNCaP cell lines. In addition, UCA1 loss-of-function could decrease KLF4 expression, subsequently, the downregulation of KRT6 and KRT13.

BLS-211 is lack of endogenous UCA1 expression and is derived from the same patient as BLZ-211 cell line. Interestingly, after knocking down the Ets-2 gene, we didn’t observed subsequent apoptosis in BLS-211 cells. Additionally, we counted the apoptotic cells using flow cytometry in both cell lines separately. Consistent with the fluorescence microscope results, the flow cytometry results revealed a significant increase of cell pro-apoptosis (upper right quadrant) after Ets-2 knockdown in BLZ-211 cells while no increase of pro-apoptosis was observed after Ets-2 knockdown in BLS-211 cells. These results suggested that UCA1 may be involved in the cell apoptosis induced by the suppression of the Ets-2.	24069250	2013	Ets-2 regulates cell apoptosis via the Akt pathway, through the regulation of urothelial cancer associated 1, a long non-coding RNA, in bladder cancer cells.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

Moreover, miR-34a suppressed the expression of WNT1 by binding with the 3'-UTR, which interact with WNT1 to inhibit the proliferation of cells.Furthermore, miR-34a inhibitor rescued the dysregulation of WNT1, B-catenin,cyclinD1,c-Myc and MMP-7 by si-XIST.Besides, XIST knockdown inhibited tumor growth in vivo. In short, the current study suggests XIST plays as an important role in colon cancer progression targeted by miR-34a via Wnt/B-catenin signaling pathway,providing a novel insight for the pathogenesis and underlying therapeutic target for colon cancer. 	29679755	2018	Long non-coding RNA XIST sponges miR-34a to promotes colon cancer progression via Wnt/B-catenin signaling pathway.	0	0	1	1	0	0	0

High XIST expression predicted poor prognosis of esophageal squamous cancer patients. Lentivirus mediated knockdown of XIST inhibited proliferation, migration and invasion of esophageal squamous cancer cells in vitro and suppressed tumor growth in vivo. Knockdown of XIST resulted in elevated expression of miR-101 and decreased expression of EZH2. Further analysis showed that XIST functioned as the competitive endogenous RNA of miR-101 to regulate EZH2 expression. Our results showed that patients with high XIST level had a significantly shortened overall survival as well as disease-free survival than those with low XIST level. 	29100288	2017	Long noncoding RNA XIST promotes malignancies of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma via regulation of miR-101/EZH2.	0	0	1	1	0	0	0

Low expression of XIST was correlated with poor prognosis and advanced tumor stage in prostate cancer patients.XIST negatively regulates the expression of miR-23a and subsequently promotes RKIP expression at post-transcriptional level. Consequently, we investigated the correlation between XIST and miR-23a, and identified miR-23a as a direct target of XIST. In addition, over-expression of miR-23a efficiently abrogated the up-regulation of RKIP induced by XIST, suggesting that XIST positively regulates the expression of RKIP by competitively binding to miR-23a. Taken together, our study indicated that lncRNA XIST acts as a tumor suppressor in prostate cancer, and this regulatory effect of XIST will shed new light on epigenetic diagnostics and therapeutics in prostate cancer.	29212233	2017	LncRNA XIST acts as a tumor suppressor in prostate cancer through sponging miR-23a to modulate RKIP expression	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

We revealed that XIST functioned as competing endogenous RNA to repress let-7i, which controlled its down-stream target BAG-1.

XIST augmented PC cell proliferation. In the present study, XIST and miR-133a reciprocally inhibited each other in PC cells. Exogenous miR-133a expression significantly inhibited PC cell proliferation. Moreover, as exhibited by luciferase reporter gene assays, miR-133a bound to XIST and the 3'UTR of EGFR by direct targeting. In PC tissues, miR-133a expression was down-regulated and EGFR expression was up-regulated; miR-133a was inversely correlated with EGFR and XIST, respectively; XIST was positively correlated with EGFR. Taken together, these findings will shed light on the role and mechanism of XIST/miR-133a/EGFR in regulating PC cells proliferation.	28295543	2017	LncRNA XIST Promotes Pancreatic Cancer Proliferation through miR-133a/EGFR.	0	0	1	1	0	0	0

In addition, multivariate analysis demonstrated XIST was an independent risk factor for prognosis. XIST over-expression enhanced, while XIST silencing hampered the cell growth in NPC. Additionally, mechanistic analysis revealed that XIST up-regulated the expression of miR-34a-5p targeted gene E2F3 through acting as a competitive 'sponge' of miR-34a-5p.	27461945	2016	Long non-coding RNA XIST exerts oncogenic functions in human nasopharyngeal carcinoma by targeting miR-34a-5p.	0	0	1	1	0	0	0

In addition, the results indicated that miR-34a-5p is a target gene of XIST and was significantly negatively correlated with XIST.

LncRNA XIST was upregulated in CRC tissues. Compared with HT29 cells that had low metastatic potential, XIST was markedly higher expressed in LoVo cells that had higher metastatic potential. Overexpression of XIST promoted the migratory and invasive potential of HT29 cells, while knockdown of XIST inhibited the migratory and invasive potential of LoVo cells. Moreover, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers, including Ecadherin, N-cadherin, and Vimentin, exhibited corresponding expression changes. In addition, miR-137 was inhibited by XIST and inhibition of miR-137 could reverse the effects of knockdown of XIST on the migratory and invasive potential of LoVo cells. Furthermore, enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) was confirmed as a target of miR-137.

Thus, specific silence oflncRNA XIST could be a future direction to develop a novel therapeutic strategy to overcome 5FU resistance of CRC patients.In addition, increased serum XIST level was associated with poor response and lower survival rate in CRC patients receiving 5FU-based treatment. However, nearly all patients receiving chemotherapy finally develop drug resistance, and this has been a major obstacle to improving the efficiency of colorectal cancer treatment.

The expression of MiR-205-5p was negatively correlated with proliferation,migration and invasion, and positively correlated with apoptosis rate of PC cells, while ZEB1 and ADPGK-AS1 had an inversed effect. Further in vitro and in vivo investigation indicated that epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) could be restrained by miR-205-5p through targeting ZEB1. ADPGK-AS1 strongly promoted the tumorigenesis via downregulating  miR-205-5p expression and induced the EMT process in vivo.

Sucrose gradients based on velocity sedimentation were utilised to separate the different components of total cell lysate, and surprisingly ZFAS1 was primarily co-localised with light polysomes. Further investigation into ribosome association through subunit dissociation studies showed that ZFAS1 was predominantly associated with the 40S small ribosomal subunit. The expression levels of ZFAS1 and of mRNAs encoding several ribosomal proteins that have roles in ribosome assembly, production and maturation were tightly correlated.

Furthermore, we confirmed that levels of ZFAS1 expression were elevated in bladder cancer tissues and cell lines compared with normal bladder tissues and normal uroepithelium cell line, respectively. Then, we observed that the expression level of ZFAS1 was positively associated with clinical stag, muscularis invasion, lymph node metastasis, and distant metastasis in bladder cancer patients. The experiments in vitro suggested that knockdown of ZFAS1 repressed bladder cancer cell proliferation via up-regulating KLF2 and NKD2 expression, and inhibited cell migration and invasion via down-regulating ZEB1 and ZEB2 expression.
